<!--  This DTD describes the format of the output of the files     -->
<!--  created by abuild dump-interfaces.  Inline comments explain  -->
<!--  the details.  The reader is assumed to have advanced         -->
<!--  familiarity with the interface system as described in the    -->
<!--  documentation.                                               -->

<!--  All location attributes have values of the form              -->
<!--  filename:lineno:colno.  Some operations are performed        -->
<!--  internally by abuild.  In those cases, location will         -->

<!--  default values, optional attributes, or optional elements    -->
<!--  will not cause the version number to be increased.  Code     -->
<!--  that reads this output should be prepared to accept and      -->
<!--  ignore unknown attributes or elements.  The item-name and    -->
<!--  item-platform attributes describe the name and platform of   -->
