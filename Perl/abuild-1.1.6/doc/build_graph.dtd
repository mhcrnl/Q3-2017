<!--  This DTD describes the format of the output of the files     -->

<!--  The version attribute is always "1".  We will only           -->
<!--  increment this if there is a change to the output such that  -->
<!--  previously valid data is either no longer valid or is valid  -->
<!--  but has different semantics.  Adding new attributes with     -->
<!--  default values, optional attributes, or optional elements    -->
<!--  will not cause the version number to be increased.  Code     -->
<!--  that reads this output should be prepared to accept and      -->
<!--  ignore unknown attributes or elements.  The item-name and    -->
