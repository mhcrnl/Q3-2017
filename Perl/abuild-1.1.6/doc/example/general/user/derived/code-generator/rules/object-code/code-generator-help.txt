You must set these variables:
  DERIVED_CODEGEN_SRC -- name of a C source file to generate
  DERIVED_CODEGEN_HDR -- name of a C header file to generate
  DERIVED_CODEGEN_INFILE -- a file containing a numerical value

These rules will generate a source file called DERIVED_CODEGEN_SRC
which will contain a function called getNumber().  That function will
return the number whose value you have placed in the file named in
DERIVED_CODEGEN_INFILE.  The file DERIVED_CODEGEN_HDR will contain a
prototype for the function.

You must include DERIVED_CODEGEN_SRC in the list of sources for one of
your build targets in order to have it included in that target.
