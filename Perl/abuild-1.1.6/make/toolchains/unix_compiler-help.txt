The "unix_compiler" toolchain is not a real toolchain intended to be
used directly by end users.  Instead, it is intended for use by
compiler toolchain support authors.  For details of its use, please
look at make/toolchains/unix_compiler.mk itself.  To study an example,
refer to make/toolchains/gcc.mk.
