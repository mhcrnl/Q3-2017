// This object represents a graph of items and their dependencies to
// each other.  Any non-empty string may be used as an item.  If it is
// desired to create a dependency graph of items other than strings,
// use the strings passed to DependencyGraph as keys to look up the
// objects in some other way.  Once items have been added to the
// graph, the graph can be checked for cycles and unknown elements.
// If there are none, then this object can provide recursively
// expanded and topologically sorted dependency lists for any item or
// for the entire graph.  Once a graph has been checked, it becomes
// immutable.  Dependency graphs may be copied.
