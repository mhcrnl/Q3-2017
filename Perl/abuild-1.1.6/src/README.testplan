To run the automated test suite, you must have 'qtest-driver' in your
path.  Then run "abuild check" from this directory.

For details about things tested in the test suite, please see comments
in abuild.test.

To do performance testing, run the script "perftest-buildtree.pl",
which is located in the tests directory.  See comments in that script
for details on how to run it and use it.
