Our figures are created with the diagramming tool called "dia".  This
is basically a free Visio clone.  We have adopted certain conventions
in the figures.  Some of these are for visual consistency, and others
are to work around limitations of the tool.

Visual Consistency
==================

 * Build items are UML objects, line width 0.10

 * Directories are folders, line width 0.10

 * Labels for build items and directories use the default font and
   size information

 * Scope and arrow labels use sans italic with font size 0.6.

 * Never use linewidth 0.  Use 0.05 for the thinnest line width.

 * For backing areas, a linewidth of 0.10 and a hollow triangle arrow
   head

 * For tree dependencies, use a linewidth of 0.10 and a filled in
   spear head as the arrow head

 * For item dependencies, use a linewidth of 0.05 and a simple arrow
   head (like a V).

 * For annotations, use a labelled oval and a simple undirected
   connecting line at 0.05.  Use font size 0.6, sans, normal as the
   label font.  Use 0.05 as the line width for the oval as well.

 * When shading for scopes, be consistent with conventions used in
   build-item-scopes.dia

 * When shading for build tree membership, use #F0F0F0.

 * When shading build items that are inherited from backing areas, use
   #A0A0A0 as the line/text color and #E0E0E0 as the background color.

 * For Abuild.interface or Abuild.conf code, use monospace at 0.7

Tool Workarounds
================

This list is as of dia 0.96.1.

 * Dia computes incorrect bounding boxes for italicized text.  In
   order to avoid clipping at the beginnings and ends of italicized
   labels, make sure each line of each italicized label starts and
   ends with a space.
