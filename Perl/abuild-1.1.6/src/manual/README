The abuild manual is a docbook document.  It is validated against
docbook version 4.4 and converted to HTML and FO with the sourceforge
docbook stylesheets.  PDF rendering is performed using apache fop.

In order to process this manual, the following environment or make
variables must be set:

  DOCBOOK_DTD: the XML docbook DTD
  DOCBOOK_XSL: the root of the docbook stylesheets
  FOP_HOME: the fop installation directory, unless fop is in the path

fop requires JAVA_HOME to be set.  Simply having a working java in
your path is not sufficient.  Without this, external image loading
does not work properly.

In addition, the "dia" program must be available to process the
figures.
