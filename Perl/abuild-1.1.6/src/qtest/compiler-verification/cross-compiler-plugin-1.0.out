===> NON-NATIVE COMPILER <===

You will be asked to run programs at various times during this test.
In each case, the executable target is "main" and is located in
.verify-tmp/src/abuild-zz_os.cpu.toolset.xcc.

The program requires three shared libraries: "Z1" and "Z2", which
can be found in the same directory as "main", and "B", which is
located in .verify-tmp/b/abuild-zz_os.cpu.toolset.xcc.

The program itself should contain the symbols A::hello() and
X::hello().  If Other::Other() is in the expected output, it should
also contain the symbol Other::Other().  The B shared library should
contain the symbol B::hello().  The Z1 shared library should contain
the symbols Y::hello() and Z1::hello().  The Z2 shared library should
contain the symbol Z2::hello().

When this program asks you to run the program, it will display the expected
output and prompt you to continue.
Hit return to continue.
