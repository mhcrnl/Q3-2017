The following standard properties may be set for any
Java-based build item:

 * abuild.java-source-version: if specified, the value of
   this property will be used for the source attribute of
   the javac task.

 * abuild.java-target-version: if specified, the value of
   this property will be used for the target attribute of
   the javac task.

 * abuild.use-ant-runtime: if set, ant runtime libraries
   will be included in the compilation classpath.  This can
   be useful for compiling custom ant tasks.

 * abuild.jar-name: the name (including extension) of the
   jar file.  The resulting jar file will be created in the
   "dist" directory of the abuild output directory.

 * abuild.main-class: the name of a class, if any, that
   implements main.  Used when abuild.wrapper-name is set.

 * abuild.wrapper-name: if this property and
   abuild.main-class are both set, a script by this name
   will be generated that will invoke the Java runtime
   environment using this jar file to invoke this main.  The
   script will include the classpath as determined by
   abuild.  On Windows, the script is usable to invoke the
   application from a Cygwin environment, and a stand-alone
   batch file is generated in addition to the script.

 * abuild.ear-name: the name (including extension) of an ear
   file to be generated.

 * abuild.application-xml: the name of an application.xml
   file to be included in the ear file.

 * abuild.war-name: the name (including extension) of a war
   file to be generated.

 * abuild.war-type: required if building a war file; must
   have the value "client" or "server".  This property
   determines where files in your classpath are copied into
   the war file.

 * abuild.web-xml: the name of a web.xml file to be included
   in the war file.

 * abuild.hook-build-items: a comma-separated list of build
   items from which hooks will be called.

 * abuild.local-buildfile: the name of a file, specified
   relative to the build item's directory, that will be
   imported from the main entry point.  This file can be
   used to define properties that can't be expressed in a
   properties file, to define resource collections, to
   create local targets, or to create hook targets.

 * abuild.junit.testsuite: the class name of the class
   containing junit test suites.  If this is set, the "test"
   target will run junit test suites defined here.

Note that at most one of abuild.jar-name, abuild.war-name,
or abuild.ear-name may be set for any given build item.
