Installation instructions for FormMagick 0.1.0

PRE-REQUISITES

You need a metric buttload of modules for this to work.  Here's the
basic list:

	CGI::Persistent
	Persistence::Object::Simple
	XML::Parser
	Text::Template
	Data::Dumper

The following are required by certain validation routines.  If you don't
use the validation routine (given in parentheses) you won't need the
module.

	Time::ParseDate			(date)
	Geography::States		(US_state)

You'll also need a web server configured to run CGIs.

INSTALLATION

Extract the tarball into a CGI-able directory.

Make sure that the session-tokens/ directory is server-writable and
executable (either mode 777, or owned by the web server user and mode
700)

RUNNING

Point your browser at
http://yourserver/yourdirectory/formmagick/testfm.pl for a demo.
