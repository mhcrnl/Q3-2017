Hi mp3riot/f2html.pl Users,

I decided to rename f2html.pl into mp3riot. the reason is, that 
the name f2html.pl does not clearly indicate, for what the program
is best suited for. Because the program has grown so much (and 
because the the name should be more attractive to get more users),
a renaming seems to be a must to me. 

During the last few days I have invested a lot of time into mp3riot.
The internal data structure, rewritten for the the version 1.0, has 
proven to be fruitful in the sense, that new functionality can be
integrated easily.  

As highlights in version 1.0, there were very flexible grouping mechanism 
and the integration of variable html code with templates. 
So you can start designing.

The new version 1.1 comes up with flexible renaming of files using their
id3tag, fixes, new output formats, etc.

Because I am not really using my own program, I have two problems. The 
first one is, that it is not very well tested. And the other is, that
I do not know, what's relly impotant to implement. So I have to rely 
on your help. 

I am looking for someone writing a manual together with me. If you are
interested in it, please contact me. 

The only thing I can say now is: Have a lot of fun!


Niko


PS: If you want to test a program, then run it on a sample data set!
