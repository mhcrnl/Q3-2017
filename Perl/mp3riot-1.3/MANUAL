Usage

	perl mp3riot [options]			 

	-h, --help                  Show this screen and exit
	-k, --mkconf                Use an assistant to write a config file
        -o, --os       <value>      Default "unix", otherwise windows. Possible values are:
				    win, unix
	-Q, --sortby   <value>      Default is "NAME" (the filename). You can sort
				    the fillist by the following criteria:
				    URLNAME, SHOWNAME, DIR, NAME, TITLE, ARTIST, 
				    ALBUM, YEAR, COMMENT, GENRE, TRACKNUM, SIZE, 
        			    MODTIME, VBR, BITRATE, FREQUENCY, MINUTES, 
				    SECONDS, FIRSTCHAR
	-n, --doublicates           Check for doublicates of files by their
	                            filename
	-D, --md5doublicates	    Check for doublicates of files by their
				    MD5 sum			    				   
        -V, --seekvalues <n,+-n,n>  Three values that have to be seperated by ",". This
				    is an useful option for --md5doublicates.
				    The first one is the offset in bytes, the second is
				    the number of bytes to seek (and the direction), and 
				    the last value tells the program where to start from (1 means to
				    start from the begining of a file, 2 means to start 
				    from the end of a file. So, a combination of 1000,-1128,2 
				    tells the programm to start 1128 bytes before the file ends 
				    (id3v1 tag is 128 bytes long!) and use
				    1000 bytes for calculation of md5 sums.				    			   
        -b, --dbfile   <file>       Write database to a file for searching it
        -m, --m3u      <file>       Write a m3u playlist file. Directory and filename or
				    "GROUPPATH" for writing m3u files for groups.
        -X, --xml      <file>       Write a xml playlist file. Directory and filename or
				    "GROUPPATH" for writing xml files for groups.	
        -L, --pls      <file>       Write a pls playlist file. Directory and filename or
				    "GROUPPATH" for writing pls files for groups.			
	-W, --b4s      <file>	    Write a b4s playlist file. Directory and filename or
				    "GROUPPATH" for writing b4s files for groups. 
        -t, --html     <file>       Write a html file. Directory and filename or
				    "GROUPPATH" for writing m3u files for groups.
        -a, --http     <name>       Define the http address for url
        -r, --remove                Remove id3tags (do you know what you are doing?)
        -i, --mp3info               Use mp3/ogg info for html output
        -e, --ext                   Remove file extensions in html output
        -f, --filesize              Use filesize for html output
        -c, --check    <ext>        Select files by their extension(s) (e.g. mp3).
				    For every extension use a seperate flag!
        -z, --skip     <number>     Skip n elements of mount/directories/names
        -p, --conf     <file>       Use a config file
        -w, --utf8     <file>       File with UTF-8 code for replacements in links
        -q, --nocs                  Do sorting not case sensitive
        -j, --statfile <file>       Write statistics to file
        -d, --dir      <directory>  Define the (multiple) directory(ies) the
                                    mp3s are stored in. For every directory use a 
				    seperate flag!
	-g, --sql      <file>       Filename to store sql table in (only for mp3 and ogg!)
        -y, --replace  <file>       Name of replacement file; in the file use
                                    <string_1>=<string_2> to transform <string_1>
                                    into <string_2>; special characters like a
                                    backslash have to be preceeded by a
                                    backslash "\\" (used for directories)
        -s, --seperate <path>       Write seperate html files for every
                                    character
	-R, --rename                Renames mp3 and ogg file using their id3tag. 
				    The use of rename_template in the configfile 
				    is optional. If rename_template is not used,
				    the program tries to create a filename like:
				    ARTIST - ALBUM - TRACKNUMBER - TITLE by using 
				    the id3tag. It assumes, that the filenames have
				    a similar format and tries to guess, whether the 
				    id3tag has enough information to create a better 
				    filename. Old and new filenames are stored in
				    RENAME.bak	
	-B, --renameback	    Renames files back using the file RENAME.bak	    
	-T, --templates             Html templates are used. They have to be defined 
                                    in the conmfig file using the commands html_head,
				    html_change, html_body, html_footer, html_sep_head.
				    See the README for avalable templates!
	-G, --groupfile <file>      Filename for grouping information:				    
	                            <groupname1>=<TYPE>=<string1>,<string2>,...
				    Prossible types are: NAME, DIR, TITLE, ARTIST,   
				    ALBUM, YEAR, COMMENT, GENRE, TRACKNUM, SIZE, MODTIME, 
				    VBR, BITRATE, FREQUENCY, MM, SS, EQUAL, FIRSTCHAR     				    
	-P, --grouppath <path>      The path, where to write the html, m3u, xml, b4s, and pls 
				    files for groups			    
        -O, --older     <number>    Only files are selected, having a modification time
				    higher than the specified days
	-Y, --younger   <number>    Only files are selected, having a modification time
				    less than the specified days
	-I, --id3tag                Use the id3 tag to get infos			    
	-S, --random    <number>    Percentage of file to select randomly (e.g. 50 to select
				    50% of files/every second file)

        Additionally, in the config file it is possible to use the commands:
        exec=           <param>     Execute system command. This command can be used multiple
				    times
	
	rename_template=<string>    string with templates for renaming files by their id3tag
				    (to be used together with --rename)
	
	The following rename templates are available:
	**TITLE**, **ARTIST**, **ALBUM**, **YEAR**, **COMMENT**, **GENRE**. **TRACKNUM**
			                            
	html_head=      <string>     Html code for the head
	html_change=    <string>     Html code if the first character between two file names
	                             change
	html_body=      <string>     Html code for each filename
	html_footer=    <string>     Html code for the foot.
	html_sep_head=  <string>     Html code for the head seperate html files by first character
	
	The following html templates are available:
	**SUMOFFILES**, **SUMOFMEGS**, **DATE**, **URLNAME**, **SHOWNAME**, **DIR**, **NAME**,
	**TITLE**, **ARTIST**, **ALBUM**, **YEAR**, **COMMENT**, **GENRE**, **TRACKNUM**, **SIZE**, 
	**MODTIME**, **VBR**, **BITRATE**, **FREQUENCY**, **MINUTES**, **SECONDS**, **HTMLINDEX**, 
	**FIRSTCHAR** 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements


mp3riot runs under all systems where perl is installed. The program was
tested und Windows 2000 and Linux.

You can download perl from http://www.perl.org


Furthermore the skript needs two perl modules. (1) getopt that is normally
part of every perl distributuion, and (2) Mp3Info. You can download Mp3Info
from http://search.cpan.org. But a version is also delivered with f2html.pl.
Under Unix systems like linux you can use the installation skripts. Or it
can be copied into a folder like "/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.1/MP3".
Under Windows the perl module "Info.pm" has to be copied to the perl
libary directory: "path were perl is installed"\lib\. There you have to
create a directory called MP3. Into this directory you have to copy the
file Info.pm.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation

mp3riot does not need to be installed. Just copy it to a directory and
execute it from this directory, or copy to a directory and set the
PATH variable.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problems under Windows and Dos

The shell under Windows is limited to 256 characters. So sometimes it is not
possible to define all option wanted. Therefor I inplemented the option to
use a config file, in that all parameters can be written.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples

If you want to create a custom config file, then execute

  perl mp3riot -k

If you want to use a configfile, just type

  perl mp3riot -p file.conf

where file.conf is your configfile.

With the command line

  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/download1 -d /home/nikolei/download2
                 -o unix -t /home/nikolei/content.html

the script searches recursively through the two directories defined by
"-d", builds a file list, sorts this filelist alphabetically by the filename,
not by the name of the directory they are stored in, and writes the list to
a html file defined by "-t". The options "-b"  and "-m" can be used
additionally or instead of "-t" to write a database file, that can be
used by the script mp3search.pl, or to create a playlist.

With the command line
 
  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/download1 -d /home/nikolei/download2 
                 -o unix -s /home/nikolei

the script does nearly the same as before. The difference is, that a
seperate html file for every different first character of the file names
is written into the directory defined by "-s". For example, the following
files could be created:

  /home/nikolei/1.html
  /home/nikolei/a.html
  /home/nikolei/b.html
  /home/nikolei/t.html

where "1.html" contains a list of all files beginning with a "1",
"a" contains all files beginning with an "a" (for example aa.dat,
ab.dat, ac.dat ...), and so on. 


With the command line
 
  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/download1 -o unix -c mp3 -c MP3
                 -t /home/nikolei/content.html

the script writes out a html file, but uses not all files it has found, but 
only files that have the suffix "mp3" or "MP3".

With the command line
 
  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/download1 -o unix -i -f -e
                 -t /home/nikolei/content.html

the script writes out a html file. For this html file it uses additional 
information, if the file is a mp3 file (the "-i" option), i.e. the length 
of the track, the bitrate, the frequency, and if it is variable encoded.
Defining "-f" option, the html file contains the size of each file, and 
given the "-e" option the file suffix is deleted in the html file.

Using additionally the "-I" flags enables the use of the id3tag.

  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/download1 -o unix -i -f -e -I
                 -t /home/nikolei/content.html
		 
The id3tag information is used for sql output and can be used for
html output with templates.		 


With the command line
 
  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/download1 -w /home/nikolei/utf8.dat
                 -o unix -t /home/nikolei/content.html

the script writes out a html file, and corrects special characters 
by changing them to their utf-8 code. Simply define a file where the utf-8 code
is stored in by using option "-w". The file containing the utf-8 code for 
replacements must have the following form:
  
  À %C0
  à %E0
  Á %C1
  
Thuch a substitution might be necessary, because you cannot download files
containing special characters in their file name. Using such a utf-8 file the 
name of a link will be replaced so that a file is downloadable. For example:

  <a href="Ànamalà.mp3">Ànamalà.mp3</a>

becomes

  <a href="%C0namal%E0.mp3">Ànamalà.mp3</a>  

With the command line
 
  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/download1 -y /home/nikolei/repl.dat
                 -o unix -t /home/nikolei/content.html

the script writes out a html file, and corrects special patterns in the 
link, if option "-y" is used. The patterns and their substitution have to be 
stored in a file. The option can be used for path name substitution. Windows
user have to be aware of using two backslashes instead of one! For example,
the file repl.dat contains the following replacement table:

  c:\\music\\good=/mp3c
  c:\\music\\bad=/mp3d

Then the pathname for a file stored in the directory c:\music\good will be
corrected to /mp3c. This option is usefull if you want to setup a webserver
for your files. Note that both strings are seperated by ------>. There are no
spaces before or after any string!

With the command line
 
  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/download1 -a http://www.yourdomain.net
                 -o unix -t /home/nikolei/content.html

the sript writes out a html file and uses a http address for the links. 
It might be necessary do use this option together with option "-z"!

With the command line
 
  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/download1 -z 2
                 -o unix -t /home/nikolei/content.html

the sript writes out a html file, and skips the first 2 directories when 
writing the link. For exmaple

  <a href="/home/nikolei/download1/name.mp3">name.mp3</a>

becomes 

  <a href="/download1/name.mp3">name.mp3</a>

This option is usedful if you have stored your file in subdirectory of 
the path where your homepage is stored in and if you want to put the files
for download into the net. It might also be useful for samba/windows shares etc.

Given the option -q in the commandline, the program does not work case 
sensitive any more. For example, it groups lower case and upper case 
characters of the same type together. So "a" and "A" are the same.

The command line
 
  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/download1 -q
                 -o unix -t /home/nikolei/content.html
                 -j /home/nikolei/statistics.html

forces the program to do the sorting ertc. not case sensitive (-q option)
and to write a statistics html file to /home/nikolei/statistics.html. The
other things are done on the same way as for the command line before

You can sort the collected file not only by their filename (default), but you can
use mp3- or tag-infos as a sorting criteria. For example:

  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/download1 --sortby DIR 
                 -o unix -t /home/nikolei/content.html
                 -j /home/nikolei/statistics.html

sort all files by the name of the directory they are stored in. The are other possible
criteria like URLNAME, SHOWNAME, DIR, NAME, TITLE, ARTIST, ALBUM, YEAR, COMMENT, GENRE, TRACKNUM, SIZE, 
MODTIME, VBR, BITRATE, FREQUENCY, MINUTES, SECONDS, FIRSTCHAR.


To write a sql data file just type
 
  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/download -o unix 
               -g /home/nikolei/sqldata.sql
		 
Only files that end with "mp3" or "MP3" make their way into the database file!
The sql data consists of the following mp3 file information: file name, song title,
artist, album, year, comment, genre, directory, filezize, modification time,
vbr, bitrate, frequency, minutes, and seconds.

If you want to check for dublicates of you files you can add the dublicates option
(-n) to you command and the filenames that exist more than one time are
listed on stdout.
 
  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/downlod1 -o unix -n
                 -g /home/nikolei/sqldata.sql


You can try to find dublicate files based on their content.   

The statement

  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/download -o unix -D
		-V 1000,-1128-2
		
tells mp3riot to search for dublicate files in /home/nikolei/download using md5sums.
The calculation of md5sums is restricted to a small part of the file. Here, the program
uses only 1000 bytes. The 1000 bytes are located 1128 bytes starting from the end of the file (2).
So the last 128 bytes (size of an idv1 tag) are not used. 


The command line
 
  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/download1 -r -o unix

simply removes every id3tag it finds.


The command line

  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/download1 -o unix -m /home/nikolei/mp3.m3u -S 20

creates a m3u playlist containing a random sample of 20% of all files of the 
folder /home/nikolei/download1.


The command line

  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/download1 -o unix -X /home/nikolei/mp3.xml
  
creates a xml playlist.

  
The command line

  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/download1 -o unix -L /home/nikolei/mp3.pls
  
creates a pls playlist.


The command line
 
  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/download1 -R -o unix

renames all files containing an id3tag (nomally mp3 and ogg files) by the conent of
the tag in the form:

  ARTIST - ALBUM - TRACKNUMBER - TITLE.mp3 
  
The information about what files have been renamed and how can be found in the 
file "RENAME.bak" in the mp3riot-directory. This file is used when you want to rename
your files back, so that they get their original name. This option is  only useful for 
for renaming new files. It is not good to run it on files that have already a good
naming shema or that already have been renamed. 

This can be done using the command line 

  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/download1 -B -o unix


In the config file you can use a template to rename files using the id3tag. you need the
commands:

rename
rename_template=<string>

<string can be any string and can be filled with the following templates:
**TITLE**, **ARTIST**, **ALBUM**, **YEAR**, **COMMENT**, **GENRE**. **TRACKNUM**

So one good choice for rename_template would be:

rename_template=**ARTIST** - **ALBUM** - **TRACKNUM** - **TITLE**


It has to be noted, that the options can be used together. For example

  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/download1 -d /home/nikolei/download2
                 -o unix -q -g -i -l -f -e -R -n -z 3 
		 -y /home/nikolei/repl.dat
		 -g /home/nikolei/mp3.sql -j /home/nikolei/stat.html
                 -w /home/nikolei/utf.dat -c MP3 -c mp3
                 -b /home/nikolei/content.db -m /home/nikolei/content.m3u
                 -t /home/nikolei/content.html -a http://mydomain.net/music

Because it is too much to write if you want to update the generated files
more frequently, you can write everything into a config file. In the config 
file you can use the same option, but they have to be written in a slighly 
different way:

  -d /home/nikolei/download1 

becomes

  d=/home/nikolei/download1 
  
  or
  
  dir=/home/nikolei/download1 

and so on. But be aware about that one or more spaces (e.g. at the end of the
line) do also belong to the filename. So when you get an error message like
"cannot open directory xxx" then it may be due to your rights reading this 
directory or because you used spaces in the definition of the directory. 

An additional option is available if you are using a config file:
"x=". with this option, that you can use several times, it is possibles to 
make system calls. For example, if you want to copy the html file to an
other directory, then just type:

  x=copy /home/nikolei/content.html /home/nikolei/public_html/content.tml

It might be also useful to write a seperate script (under dos a so called
batch file). This file could execute the script mp3riot several times 
using different config files. This can be useful if you want to handle some 
directories in a different way. 

Or you can use the batch option to updaten or create you aql database:
  
  x=mysql mp3 < sqldata.sql


Fortunately, everybody is free to modify the html code within the script 
to adjust the output. 


If you want to use your own html code, then you can do this using the 
tamplates option. Because you have to fill some variables, it is best to
use a confiug file for it. See the Html templates section for further 
details.

You can select file not only by their extension, but also by their
modification time. Yon can select files that are a specified number of day
older ("-O") and/or younger ("-Y") than the current date. For example:

  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/download1 -q
                 -o unix -t /home/nikolei/content.html
		 -O 10
		 -Y 20

With this options, you can select files, that are older than 10 and younger 
than 20 days.

Another useful option is grouping. For example, if you have some files 
beginning with the same string, and you want to build a seperate
html file for them, you can do this by specifiing the in a groupfile.
The syntax within the groupfile is:

  <groupname1>=<TYPE>=<string1>,<string2>,...
  <groupname2>=<TYPE>=<string1>,<string2>,...
  end so on.

<groupname1> is the name of the group 1. <TYPE> is the type of group.
And <string1> is the first string in the group to search for.
Possible values for type are:

  NAME      : the name of the file
  FIRSTCHAR : the first character of the filename
  DIR       : the directory, where the file is stored in
  TITLE     : the title of the song (using id3tag)
  ARTIST    : the artist of the song (using id3tag)
  ALBUM     : the album of the song (using id3tag)
  YEAR      : the year of the song (using id3tag)
  COMMENT   : the comment of the song (using id3tag)
  GENRE     : the genre of the song (using id3tag)
  SIZE      : the size of the file
  MODTIME   : the modification time of the file (in non-leap seconds since January 1st, 1970 UTC)
  VBR       : is 1, if the song is encodet with variable bitrate
  BITRATE   : the bitrate of the song
  FREQUENCY : the frequency of the song
  MM        : song lentgh in minutes
  SS        : song length in seconds
  EQUAL     : special type, used to build groups automatically based on characteristis

Fortunately, every group can have a different <TYPE>.

For example, to put all songs from Red Hot Chili Peppers into one file,
and the ones from New Model Army into another, create a group file
like this:

  Red Hot Chili Peppers=NAME=Red Hot Chili Peppers,Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers
  New Model Army=NAME=New Model Army,New_Model_Army

EQUAL is a special <TYPE>. It functions like an aggrigator. The left and
the right statement (<groupname> and <string>) have to be <TYPES> (e.g. NAME, 
DIR, ...). Both should be the same, So that:

 DIR=EQUAL=DIR

will group together all file, that are stored in the same directory. The output
file will then be named after the name of DIR.


On the commandline, you can specify the groupfile using the "-G" option.
Additionally, a path has to be specified, where to store the html files
for the defined groups. This can ba done using the "-P" option. 
The names of the html files for the groups are then <groupname>.html.
All other files, that do not match a group, are written into the 
normal file.

  perl mp3riot -d /home/nikolei/download1 -q
                 -o unix -t /home/nikolei/therest.html
		 -G /home/nikolei/groupfile
		 -p /home/nikolei

The type EQUAL can be used to make a seperate html file for every different characteristic. For
example, you can build a seperate html file for any single (atomic sub-) directory, that exists,
by defining:

DIR=EQUAL=DIR

The html files are stored in the specified directory. To make html file for any genre, year or whatever,
is straightforward.

GENRE=EQUAL=GENRE

or

YEAR=EQUAL=YEAR

All regular types can be used.

    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changing html layout

If you want to change the layout of the htmloutput, you have to go directly 
into the code (although it is planned to make changing the htmlcode more
flexible by using templates). The functions that contain html are:

Writestatfile: here you can change the layout of the statistics file.

Getmp3info: in this function layout is defined when using the command line
            parameter "mp3info"
	    
Getogginfo: in this function layout is defined when using the command line
            parameter "mp3info"

Date: here the layout of the actual date is defined.

Writehtml: here some layout of the html output can be changed.

Htmlheader: here you can change the header for "Writehtml".

Htmlfooter: here you can change the footer for "Writehtml".

Htmlchange: here the html code is defined when the first character from 
            on file to the other changes.

Htmlbody: here the htmlcode for writing each file is defined.

Writesephtml: here seperate html files for every different first character
              is written out.

Sephtmlheader: here the header for "Writesephtml" is defined.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Html templates

Since version 1.0 it is possible to use html templates. Templates have to
be activated usinf the "-T" oder "--templates" flag. Additionally, in the 
configuration file, variables with html code and templates have to be filled.

There are four varibales to can fill with your own html code. These are:

  html_head	: The header of an html file
  html_sep_head : The header of a html file for seperated files by fist character
  html_body	: the body, or simply, every song, file or record
  html_change	: if the first character between two filenames change

Templates are identified via keywords. Every keyword start with two asterics and
also ends with two asterics. Please note, that not all templates are available 
for all variables! Implemeted templates are:

  **SUMOFFILES** : Sum of files listed in html file 
  **SUMOFMEGS**  : Sum of megabytes of files listed in html file
  **DATE**	 : Date of creation of html file
  **URLNAME**	 : URL name of file (name within the <a href=...>-tag)
  **SHOWNAME**   : The name that is shown  (name between the tag <a></a>
  **DIR**	 : Directory where the file is located
  **NAME**	 : Original name of the file
  **TITLE**	 : Tile of the song (using id3-tag)
  **ARTIST**	 : Artist of the song (using id3-tag)
  **ALBUM**	 : Album of the song (using id3-tag)
  **YEAR**	 : Year the album was released (using id3-tag)
  **COMMENT**	 : Commentstring of the song (using id3-tag)
  **GENRE**	 : Genre of the song (using id3-tag)
  **SIZE**	 : Fize of the file in kilobytes
  **MODTIME**	 : Modification time of the file in the fromat <year>-<month>-<day>
  **VBR**	 : Indicator whether variable bitrate is used or not, if it is an
 		   mp3 or ogg vorbis file
  **BITRATE**	 : Bitrate, if it is an mp3 or ogg vorbis file
  **FREQUENCY**  : Frequency of the file, if it is an mp3 or ogg vorbis file
  **MINUTES**	 : Minutes, the song lasts, if it is an mp3 or ogg vorbis file
  **SECONDS**	 : Seconds, the song lasts, if it is an mp3 or ogg vorbis file
  **HTMLINDEX**  : Prints a linked index of fist chararacters for html output
  **FIRSTCHAR**  : The first character of the filename

For example, in order to get exactly the same result for html output as 
the program gernerates by default, you can define the following varibales:

  html_head=<html><body>**HTMLINDEX**<br>
  html_change=<P><A HREF="#top">back to top</A></P><P><A NAME="**FIRSTCHAR**">**FIRSTCHAR**</A></P>
  html_body=<BR><A HREF="**URLNAME**">**SHOWNAME**</A> **SIZE** kb **MINUTES**' **SECONDS**''
  html_footer=<BR><P><A HREF="#top">back to top</a></P><P>Sum of files is **SUMOFFILES**.<br>Sum of megabytes is **SUMOFMEGS**.<br>Generated by mp3riot on **DATE**, (c)2000-2003 Nikolei Steinhage</P></body></html>
  html_sep_head=<HTML><BODY><P><B></B>**FIRSTCHAR**</P>

Todo

There are still a lot of things to do. But first of all I have to write a
better manual with a lot of examples in it. To me, this seems very necessary,
bacause some users may encounter problems using this program. Some feature
like sql-interface, advanced sorting and grouping have to be implemented.
PHP interface has to be written. Change all command line examples to config file examples.
