*Futures:
** I'd like to build some 'intelligence' into the computer player
*** think about how to have different kinds of computer players
    perhaps a very aggressive player, one that tries to find 'elegant'
    words, one that always tries to grow, weighting ending letters
    differently
** it would be nice to allow more than two players
    this would require some kind of client-server front-end
    (this is now possible, in theory, with the new object structure)
