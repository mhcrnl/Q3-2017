Games::WordDig (the main part of this distribution), is a perl module
and follows the standard methods for installation.  After unpacking
WordDig.version.tgz into a reasonable location, execute the following
steps: 

   prompt$  perl Makefile.pl
   prompt$  make
   prompt$  make test

and, if there are no errors in the 'make test' step:

   prompt$  make install

This should install the Games::WordDig package in your @INC path.  Now
you can get on to the fun part ... playing with the front ends, and
maybe even writing your own. (For now, there is only a command line
front end distributed with the Games::WordDig module.  Even this is
not very pretty -- it was written to test the module, but is still
capable of playing a game.)

These are located in the samples directory, and each has an associated
README.name file with instructions for installing it.  (The README is in
samples directory.)
