                            a word game in Perl
                    ___________________________________
   
   Word Dig is form of word play my wife and I 
   discovered/invented/something while we were driving around on a
   vacation. The rules are simple -

   - one person starts by naming a word (and using it in a sentence)
   - the next person must then name a word beginning with the last letter
     of the previous word, and of the same length (plus or minus one
     letter).
   - play continues until one person gives up (or both decide to draw).
   - words may not be repeated
   
   Games::WordDig is a perl module implementing the guts of Word Dig,
   and distributed with various front-ends to play the game. (Er- at
   least it will be, once it is completed).  Currently two sample
   games are included in this tarball at samples/CLI/word-dig and
   samples/GNOME/gword-dig.  Both are playable, but are just demos
   ... a real game should be much nicer to play.
   
   Games::WordDig (or just WordDig) is currently moving toward a 0.4
   release, which will be a public release version -- and suitible for 
   playing.
   
   Games::WordDig follows the linux release naming convention:  even
   major releases are stable releases with only bug fixing done, odd
   numbered major releases are development releases with new
   functionality being added.  The 0.3.x releases represents a public 
   pre-beta.  Feature completeness for the 0.4 release will mark the
   0.3.5 release, and subsequent releases will be bug-fix releases only.
