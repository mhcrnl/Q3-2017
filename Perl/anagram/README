Anagram.pl is a Perl script to find anagrams. It uses 
word lists from the aspell package.

Installation: download the script, install it anywhere 
you want, make it executable, and run it. Make sure 
that you have installed aspell, because anagram.pl uses 
word lists provided by the aspell package.
If you want, you can change anagram.pl to use another 
word list than the default.

The goal is to make an interactive graphical program 
in C++. This script is mainly for developing and testing
some techniques. But it's fun anyway ;-)
