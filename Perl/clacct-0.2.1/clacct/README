NOTES

**The command-line accountant is just one file, written in PERL 5

**It is assumed you have Perl 5 in /usr/bin. If not, alter the first line 
of the file 'clacct' to read accordingly.

**Data is kept in the user's home directory, under home/username/.clacct/

*******************
TO INSTALL, simply 'su' to the root login, if you have permission and:

cp clacct /usr/local/bin
cp clarule /usr/local/bin

or if you don't have root access, just run from your account by typing:

clacct

******************
FOR GENERAL HELP, type 

clacct --help

*******************
RENAMING COMMAND-LINE ACCOUNTANT
clacct was originally named 'cla' so that it could be quickly
typed. To avoid conflicts with existing software, the name
was changed to 'clacct'. You may simply change the name of the 
program by the following steps (replace 'cla' with target name
in following commands):

1) shell> mv clacct cla

2) open the new file with your favorite editor

3) change the line

my $progname="clacct";

to

my $progname="cla";

4) it is also recommended that you change the line

my $cladir=$ENV{HOME} . "/.clacct";

to

my $cladir=$ENV{HOME} . "/.cla";

5) then copy the old data to the new directory, then remove the old

shell> cp ~/.clacct/* ~/.cla
shell> rm -rf ~/.clacct
