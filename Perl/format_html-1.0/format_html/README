format_html.pl
------------
format_html.pl is under the GPL

format_html.pl is a perl script that : 

	- uppercases HTML key word.
	- replaces special character by their HTML code.
	- indents HTML code.


You can edit format_html.pl to change number of space for indentation by setting the $space_char value.
And you can add key word to do no care for indentation in the list @list_tag_expect.


format_html.pl can have several files in argument, and it does a copy of them (.bak) before to replace them.
There is an option (-a) to make a strict indentation.
