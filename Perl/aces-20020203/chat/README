-- README -- ACES IRC Perl Modules --

This is the README for ACES cvs.

The PROJECT is in HEAVY development; nothing is stable (not excluding the API)
so don't rely on interfaces staying the same.

-- Running the test program... --

In the directory of gui3.pl, there should be the IRC directory with Stream.pm
inside. Create a file .gui3rc containing something like:
  irc.server: irc.openprojects.net
  irc.port: 6667
  session.buddyList: ircbuddies
These are the values that the program will use when running. The
session.buddyList value is the name of the file that contains a plain text
list of users for whom the program should check the online status (the names
should be separated by newlines).

Windows may not close by themselves, so it is necessary to use buttons and the
such of the window manager in order to close them. Additionally, the "about"
box, as well as the "reply" dialogues all make the main window inaccessible
until the dialogues are closed (by clicking either of the buttons).
