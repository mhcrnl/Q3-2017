  # If the exercise is updated, we want to make sure other people testing
  # your code don't think you've made a mistake if things have changed!
INIT_comment: |-
  # 'INIT' is a phaser, it makes sure that the test data is available before everything else
  # starts running (otherwise we'd have to shove the test data into the middle of the file!)

example: |-
  sub hello {
    return 'Hello, World!';
  }

stub: |-
  sub hello {
    # Remove the comments and write some code here to pass the test suite.
