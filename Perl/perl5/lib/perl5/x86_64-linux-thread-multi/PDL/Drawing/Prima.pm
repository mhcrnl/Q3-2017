=head1 SYNOPSIS

Each of the methods comes with a small sample snippet. To see how it
looks, copy this synopsis and replace the code in the
C<Example code goes here> block with the example code.

 use strict;
 use warnings;
 use PDL;
 use PDL::Drawing::Prima;
 use Prima qw(Application);
 
 my $window = Prima::MainWindow->create(
     text    => 'PDL::Drawing::Prima Test',
     onPaint => sub {
         my ( $self, $canvas) = @_;
 
         # wipe the canvas:
         $canvas->clear;
         
         ### Example code goes here ###
         
         # Draw a sine curve on the widget:
         my ($width, $height) = $canvas->size;
         my $x = sequence($width);
         my $y = ( sin($x / 20) + 1 ) * $height/2;
         $canvas->pdl_polylines($x, $y, lineWidths => 2);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a number of PDL-threaded functions and bindings for use
with the Prima toolkit. Many of the functions are PDL bindings for the
standard Prima drawing functions. Others are useful functions for color
manipulation, or getting data into a form that PDL knows how to handle.
I generally divide the subroutines of this module into two categories:
B<methods> and B<functions>. The methods are subroutines that operate on a
Prima widget; the functions are subroutines that act on or return piddles.

Most of the methods given here are PDLified versions of the Prima drawing API
functions, which are documented under L<Prima::Drawable>. In general, where the
Prima API uses singular nouns, I here use plural nouns. A few of the methods
are only available in this module, mostly added to accomodate the needs of
L<PDL::Graphics::Prima>, the plotting library built on these bindings.

This bindings can be applied to B<any> object whose class is derived from
L<Prima::Drawable>, including displayed widgets and abstract canvases such
as L<Prima::PS::Drawable>. If you create your own derived canvas, these
methods should Just Work. (I wish I could take credit for this, but it's
really due to the fact that Prima's internals are very well engineered.)

=head1 COORDINATE ORIGIN

The Prima image coordinate origin is located in lower left corner, which is
where you would expect to find it when creating plots. However, it is different
from the way that many graphics libraries do their coordinates.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 piddle_of_patterns_for

If you want PDL to thread over line patterns, but you want to use the standard
Prima line patterns, you'll need to convert them line patterns to a piddle.
This works very simply like this:

 my $patterns = piddle_of_patterns_for(lp::Solid, lp::Dash);

This creates a piddle with the two patterns so that you could have PDL thread
over them.

You can also create your own line pattern piddles by hand. I recommend you use
byte array, since otherwise it will be converted to byte arrays for you.
The first element of a row in your byte array
specifies the number of pixels to be "on", the second specifies the number to be
"off", the third specifies the number to be "on" again, the fourth "off", the
fifth "on", etc. If that doesn't make sense, hopefully a couple of examples will
help clarify.

This example creates the equivalent of lp::Dash:

 my $dash_pattern = byte (9, 3);

This example creates a piddle with four line types: lp::Solid, lp::Dash,
lp::ShortDash, and lp::DashDot:
 
 my $patterns = byte q[ 1; 9 3; 3 3; 9 3 1 3];

and should be identical to

 my $patterns = piddle_of_patterns_for(
     lp::Solid, lp::Dash, lp::ShortDash, lp::DashDot);
 
When you create a byte piddle, all of the patterns must have the same number of
bytes in their specification. Of course, different patterns have different
lengths, so in that case simply pad the shorter specifications with zeroes.

=cut

# Builds a piddle of patterns with the appropriate sizes, etc.
sub piddle_of_patterns_for {
	# Make sure they're not being stupid:
	croak("You must supply at least one pattern to make a pattern piddle")
		if @_ == 0;

	# First get the longest pattern:
	my $length = 0;
	foreach(@_) {
		$length = length($_) if $length < length($_);
	}
	
	use PDL::NiceSlice;
	
	# Create the new byte array with the appropriate dimensions:
	my $to_return = zeroes(byte, $length, scalar(@_));
	$to_return .= $to_return->sequence;
	for (my $i = 0; $i < @_; $i++) {
		# Get a slice and update it:
		my $slice = $to_return(:,$i);
		substr ${$slice->get_dataref}, 0, length($_[$i]), $_[$i];
		
		# Make sure the modifications propogate back to the original:
		$slice->upd_data;
	}
	
	no PDL::NiceSlice;
	
	return $to_return;
}

=head2 piddle_of_handles_for

THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED AND NOW DIES IF YOU TRY TO USE IT. Performing
the same PDL drawing operation on different widgets via PDL threading
makes atomic behavior very difficult, so this functionality has been removed.
If you think you'd like this behavior back, please let me know.

=cut

sub piddle_of_handles_for {
	croak("piddle_of_handles_for has been deprecated");

=head1 METHODS

The methods described below are a bit unusual for PDL functions. First, they are
not actually PDL functions at all but are methods for C<Prima::Drawable>
objects. Second, their signatures will look a bit funny. Don't worry too much
about that, though, because they will resemble normal signatures close enough
that you should be able to understand them, I hope.

=head2 pdl_arcs

=for sig

  Prima Signature: (widget; x(); y(); x_diameter(); y_diameter();
                     start_angle(); end_angle(); properties)

=for ref

Draws arcs, i.e. incomplete ellipses.

Applicable properties include colors, backColors,
lineEnds, linePatterns, lineWidths, rops, rop2s, and translates.

The arcs go from the C<start_angle>s to the C<end_angle>s along the
ellipses centered at the C<x>s and C<y>s, with the specified x- and
y-diameters. The angles are measured in degrees, not radians.
The difference between this command and L</chords> or L</sectors> is that
C<arcs> does not connect the dangling ends.

Here's a simple example:

=for example

 # Draw a bunch of random arcs on $canvas:
 my $N_arcs = 20;
 my ($x_max, $y_max) = $canvas->size;
 my $xs = zeroes($N_arcs)->random * $x_max;
 my $ys = $xs->random * $y_max;
 my $dxs = $xs->random * $x_max / 4;
 my $dys = $xs->random * $y_max / 4;
 my $th_starts = $xs->random * 360;
 my $th_stops = $xs->random * 360;
 
 # Now that we've generated the data, call the command:
 $canvas->pdl_arcs($xs, $ys, $dxs
                , $dys, $th_starts, $th_stops);

If you put that snippet of code in the C<onPaint> method, as
suggested in the synopsis, a completely new set of arcs will get
redrawn whenever you resize your window.

Compare to the Prima method L<Prima::Drawable/arc>. Closely related
routines include L</pdl_chords> and L</pdl_sectors>. See also
L</pdl_fill_chords>, and L</pdl_fill_sectors>, L</pdl_ellipses>, and
L</pdl_fill_ellipses>.

Spline drawing provides a similar functionality, though more complex and
more powerful. There are no PDL bindings for the spline functions yet.
See L<Prima::Drawable/spline> for more information.



=for bad

pdl_arcs does not process bad values.
It will set the bad-value flag of all output piddles if the flag is set for any of the input piddles.

=head2 pdl_bars

  Prima Signature: (widget; x1(); y1(); x2(); y2(); properties)

=for ref

Draws filled rectangles from corners (x1, y1) to (x2, y2).

Applicable properties include colors, backColors, clipRects,
fillPatterns, rops, rop2s, and translates.

=for example

 # Draw 20 random filled rectangles on $canvas:
 my $N_bars = 20;
 my ($x_max, $y_max) = $canvas->size;
 my $x1s = zeroes($N_bars)->random * $x_max;
 my $y1s = $x1s->random * $y_max;
 my $x2s = $x1s + $x1s->random * ($x_max - $x1s);
 my $y2s = $y1s + $x1s->random * ($y_max - $y1s);
 my $colors = $x1s->random * 2**24;
 
 # Now that we've generated the data, call the command:
 $canvas->pdl_bars($x1s, $y1s, $x2s, $y2s
         , colors => $colors);

If you put that snippet of code in the C<onPaint> method, as
suggested in the synopsis, a completely new set of filled rectangles
will get redrawn whenever you resize your window.

Compare to the Prima method L<Prima::Drawable/bar>. See also
L</pdl_rectangles>, which is the unfilled equivalent, and L</pdl_clears>,
which is sorta the opposite of this.

  Prima Signature: (widget; x(); y(); x_diameter(); y_diameter();
                           start_angle(); end_angle(); properties)

=for ref

Draws arcs (i.e. incomplete ellipses) whose ends are connected by a line.

The chord starts at C<start_angle> and runs to C<end_angle> along the ellipse
centered at C<x>, C<y>, with their specified diameters C<x_diameter>,
C<y_diameter>. Unlike L</arcs> or L</sectors>, it connects
the ends of the arc with a straight line. The angles are
measured in degrees, not radians.

Applicable properties include colors, backColors, clipRects,
lineEnds, linePatterns, lineWidths, rops, rop2s, and translates.

=for example

 # For this example, you will need:
 use PDL::Char;
 
 # Draw a bunch of random arcs on $canvas:

 # make a small list of patterns:

 # Randomly select 20 of those patterns:

=head2 pdl_clears

  Prima Signature: (widget; x1(); y1(); x2(); y2(); properties)

=for ref

Clears the specified rectangle(s).

Applicable properties include backColors, rop2s, and translates.

=for example

 my ($width, $height) = $canvas->size;
 # Begin by drawing a filled rectangle:
 $canvas->color(cl::Blue);
 $canvas->bar(0, 0, $width, $height);
 
 # Now cut random rectangles out of it:
 my $N_chunks = 20;
 my $x1 = random($N_chunks) * $width;

 my $y1 = random($N_chunks) * $width;
 my $y2 = random($N_chunks) * $width;
 $canvas->pdl_clears($x1, $y1, $x2, $y2);

Like the other examples, this will give you something new whenever you
resize the window if you put the code in the onPaint method, as the

Compare to the Prima method L<Prima::Drawable/clear>. In practice I

technically this is meant for erasing, not drawing.

=head2 pdl_ellipses

  Prima Signature: (widget; x(); y(); x_diameter();
                          y_diameter(); properties)

=for ref

Draws ellipses centered at C<x>, C<y> with diameters C<x_diameter> and
C<y_diameter>.

Applicable properties include colors, backColors, clipRects,
linePatterns, lineWidths, rops, rop2s, and translates.

To draw circles, just use the same x- and y-diameter.

=for example

 # Draw increasingly taller ellipses along the center line
 my $N_ellipses = 10;
 my ($width, $height) = $canvas->size;
 # horizontal positions evenly spaced
 my $x = (sequence($N_ellipses) + 0.5) * $width / $N_ellipses;
 # Vertically, right in the middle of the window
 my $y = $height/2;
 # Use the same x-diameter
 my $x_diameter = 15;
 # Increase the y-diameter
 my $y_diameter = $x->xlinvals(10, $height/1.3);
 
 # Use the pdl_ellipses method to draw!
 $canvas->pdl_ellipses($x, $y, $x_diameter, $y_diameter, lineWidths => 2);

For this example, if you resize the window, the distance between the ellipses
and the ellipse heights will adjust automatically.

Compare to the Prima method L<Prima::Drawable/ellipse>. The filled
equivalent is L</pdl_fill_ellipses>. See also L</pdl_arcs>, L</pdl_chords>,

Draws filled chords (see L</pdl_chords>).

Applicable properties include colors, backColors, clipRects,

Chords are partial elipses that run from C<start_angle> to C<end_angle>

The ends are connected with a line and the interior is filled. Use this to
draw the open-mouth part of a smiley face.

=head2 pdl_fillpolys

  Prima Signature: (widget; x(n); y(n); properties)

=for ref

Draws and fills a polygon with (mostly) arbitrary edge vertices.

Applicable properties include colors, backColors, clipRects,
fillPatterns, fillWindings, rops, rop2s, and translates.

NOTE: there is B<no> underscore between C<fill> and C<poly>, which is
different from the other C<fill> methods!

This is useful for drawing arbitrary filled shapes and for visualizing
integrals. Splines would be the better choice if you want to draw curves, but
a PDL interface to splines is not (yet) implemented.

Unlike most of the other methods, this one actually makes a half-hearted
effort to process bad values. In addition to the IEEE bad values of C<nan>
and C<inf>, PDL has support for bad values. Unlike in C<pdl_polys>,
C<pdl_fillpolys> will simply skip any point that is marked as bad, but drawing
the rest of the polygon. In other words, it reduces the degree of your polygon
by one. If you sent it four points and one of them was bad, you would get a
triangle instead of a quadralaters.

Infinities are also handled, though not perfectly. There are a few
situations where C<pdl_polys> will correctly draw what you mean but
C<pdl_fillpolys> will not.

Because this skips bad data altogether, if you have too much bad data
(i.e. fewer than three good points), the routine will simply not draw
anything. I'm debating if this should croak, or at least give a warning.
(Of course, a warning to STDOUT is rather silly for a GUI toolkit.)

For example:

=for example

 # Create a poorly sampled sine-wave
 my ($width, $height) = $canvas->size;
 my $x = sequence(23)/4;
 my $y = $x->sin;
 
 # Draw it in such a way that it fits the canvas nicely
 $canvas->pdl_fillpolys($x * $width / $x->max,
     ($y + 1) * $height / 2, fillWindings => 1
 );

Resizing the window will result in a similar rendering that fits the aspect
ratio of your (resized) window.

L</pdl_bars> and L<pdl_polylines>.

=for ref

Draws filled sectors, i.e. a pie-slices or Pac-Mans.

Applicable properties include colors, backColors, clipRects,
fillPatterns, rops, rop2s, and translates.

More specifically, this draws an arc from C<start_angle> to C<end_angle>
along the ellipse centered at C<x>, C<y>, with specified x- and y-diameters.
Like L</fill_chords>, this command connects the end points of the arc, but
unlike L</fill_chords>, it does so by drawing two lines, both of which
also connect to the ellipse's center. This results in shapes that look
like pie pieces or pie remnants, depending of whether you're a glass-half-full
or glass-half-empty sort of person.

=for example

 # Draw a bunch of random arcs on $canvas:
 my $N_chords = 20;
 my ($x_max, $y_max) = $canvas->size;
 my $xs = zeroes($N_chords)->random * $x_max;

 my $dys = $xs->random * $y_max / 4;

=head2 pdl_flood_fills

  Prima Signature: (widget; x(); y(); fill_color();
                   singleborder(); properties)

=for ref

Fill a contiguous region.

NOTE THIS MAY NOT WORK ON MACS! There seems to be a bug in either Prima or
in Mac's X-windows library that prevents this function from doing its job as
described. That means that flood filling is not cross-platform, at least not
at the moment. This notice will be removed from the latest version of this
documentation as soon as the item is addressed, and it may be that your
version of Prima has a work-around for this problem. At any rate, it only
effects Mac users.

Applicable properties include colors, backColors, clipRects,
fillPatterns, rops, rop2s, and translates.

Note that C<fill_color> is probably B<not> what you think it is. The
color of the final fill is determined by your C<colors> property. What,
then, does C<fill_color> specify? It indicates how Prima is supposed to
perform the fill. If C<singleborder> is zero, then C<fill_color> is the
color of the B<boundary> to which Prima is to fill. In other words, if you had
a bunch of intersecting lines that were all red and you wanted the interior
of those intersecting lines to be blue, you would say something like

 $widget->pdl_flood_fills($x, $y, cl::Red, 0, colors => cl::Blue);

On the other hand, if C<singleborder> is 1, then the value of C<fill_color>
tells Prima to replace every contiguous pixel B<of color> C<fill_color> with
the new color specified by C<colors> (or the current color, if no C<colors>
piddle is given).

=for example

 # Generate a collection of intersecting
 # circles and triangles
 my ($width, $height) = $canvas->size;
 my $N_items = 20;
 my $x = random($N_items) * $width;
 my $y = random($N_items) * $width;
 $canvas->pdl_ellipses($x, $y, 20, 20, lineWidths => 3);
 $canvas->pdl_symbols($x, $y, 3, 0, 0, 10, 1, lineWidths => 3);
 
 # Fill the interior of those circle/triangle intersections
 $canvas->pdl_flood_fills($x, $y, cl::Black, 0);

If you put that snippet of code in the example from the synopsis, you should
see a number of narrow rectangles intersecting circles, with the interior of
both shapes filled. Resizing the window will lead to randomly changed
positions for those space-ship looking things.

L<pdl_clears> and the various fill-based drawing methods.

Draws a multi-segment line with the given x- and y-coordinates.

Applicable properties include colors, backColors, clipRects,
lineEnds, lineJoins, linePatterns, lineWidths, rops, rop2s, and translates.

This method goes to great lengths to Do What You Mean, which is actually
harder than you might have expected. This is the backbone for the Lines
plot type of L<PDL::Graphics::Prima>, so it needs to be able to handle all
manner of strange input. Here is what happens when you specify strange
values:

=over

=item IEEE nan or PDL Bad Value

If either of these values are specified in the middle of a line drawing, the
polyline will completely skip this point and begin drawing a new polyline at
the next point.

=item both x and y are inf and/or -inf

There is no sensible way of interpreting what it means for both x and y to
be infinite, so any such point is skipped, just like nan and Bad.

=item either x or y is inf or -inf

If an x value is infinite (but the paired y value is not), a horizontal line
is drawn from the previous x/y pair out to the edge of a widget; another line
is drawn from the edge to the next x/y pair. The behavior for an infinite y
value is similar, except that the line is drawn vertically.

For example, the three points (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, inf), (3, 1), (4, 1) would
be rendered as a line from (0, 1) to (1, 1), then a vertical line straight
up from (1, 1) to the upper edge of the widget or clipping rectangle, then
a vertical line straight down to (3, 1) from the upper edge of the widget or
clipping rectangle, then a horizontal line from (3, 1) to (4, 1).

=item x and/or y is a large value

If x or y is a large value (say, both x and y are 5e27 when the rest of your
numbers are of the order of 100), it will not be possible to actually show a
renderin of a line to that point. However, it is possible to correctly render
the slope of that point out to the edge of the clipping rectangle. Thus the
slope of the line from within-clip points to large values is faithfully
rendered.

=back

Here's an example of how to plot data using C<pdl_polylines> (though you'd
do better to use L<PDL::Graphics::Prima> to create plots):

=for example

 # Draw a sine curve on the widget:
 my $x = sequence(200);
 my $y = ( sin($x / 20) + 1 ) * 50;
 $canvas->pdl_polylines($x, $y);

Compare to the Prima method L<Prima::Drawable/polyline>. See also L<pdl_lines>
and L<pdl_fillpolys>.



=for bad

pdl_polylines processes bad values.
It will set the bad-value flag of all output piddles if the flag is set for any of the input piddles.

=head2 pdl_rectangles

  Prima Signature: (widget; x1(); y1(); x2(); y2(); properties)

=for ref

Draws a rectangle from corner (x1, y1) to corner (x2, y2).

Applicable properties include colors, backColors, clipRects,
linePatterns, lineWidths, rops, rop2s, and translates.

=for example

 # Draw 20 random rectangles on $canvas:
 my $N_bars = 20;
 my ($x_max, $y_max) = $canvas->size;
 my $x1s = zeroes($N_bars)->random * $x_max;
 my $y1s = $x1s->random * $y_max;
 my $x2s = $x1s + $x1s->random * ($x_max - $x1s);
 my $y2s = $y1s + $x1s->random * ($y_max - $y1s);
 my $colors = $x1s->random * 2**24;
 
 # Now that we've generated the data, call the command:
 $canvas->pdl_rectangles($x1s, $y1s, $x2s, $y2s
         , colors => $colors);

If you put that snippet of code in the C<onPaint> method, as
suggested in the synopsis, a completely new set of rectangles
will get redrawn whenever you resize your window.

Compare to the Prima method L<Prima::Drawable/rectangle>. See also
L</pdl_bars>, which is the filled equivalent, and L</pdl_lines>, which
draws a line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) instead. Also, there is a Prima
method that does not (yet) have a pdl-based equivalent known as
L<Prima::Drawable/rects3d>, which draws beveled edges around a rectangle.

=head2 pdl_sectors

  Prima Signature: (widget; x(); y(); x_diameter(); y_diameter(); start_angle(); end_angle(); properties)

=for ref

Draws the outlines of sectors, i.e. a pie-slices or Pac-Mans.

Applicable properties include colors, backColors, clipRects,
lineEnds, linePatterns, lineWidths, rops, rop2s, and translates.

More specifically, this draws an arc from C<start_angle> to C<end_angle>
along the ellipse centered at C<x>, C<y>, with specified x- and y-diameters.
Like L</fill_chords>, this command connects the end points of the arc, but
unlike L</fill_chords>, it does so by drawing two lines, both of which
also connect to the ellipse's center. This results in shapes that look
like pie pieces or pie remnants, depending of whether you're a glass-half-full
or glass-half-empty sort of person.

=for example

 # For this example, you will need:
 use PDL::Char;
 
 # Draw a bunch of random sectors on $canvas:
 my $N_chords = 20;
 my ($x_max, $y_max) = $canvas->size;
 my $xs = zeroes($N_chords)->random * $x_max;
 my $ys = $xs->random * $y_max;
 my $dxs = $xs->random * $x_max / 4;
 my $dys = $xs->random * $y_max / 4;
 my $th_starts = $xs->random * 360;
 my $th_stops = $xs->random * 360;
 
 # make a small list of patterns:
 my $patterns_list = PDL::Char->new(
          [lp::Solid, lp::Dash, lp::DashDot]);
 
 # Randomly select 20 of those patterns:
 my $rand_selections = ($xs->random * 3)->byte;
 use PDL::NiceSlice;
 my $patterns = $patterns_list($rand_selections)->transpose;
 
 # Now that we've generated the data, call the command:
 $canvas->pdl_sectors($xs, $ys, $dxs
                , $dys, $th_starts, $th_stops
                , linePatterns => $patterns);

Compare to the Prima method L<Prima::Drawable/sector>. The filled equivalent
is L</pdl_fill_sectors>. There is a whole slew of arc-based drawing methods
including L</pdl_arcs>, L</pdl_chords>, and L<pdl_ellipses> along with their

=head2 PDL-ONLY METHODS

These are drawing methods that have no analogous Prima::Drawable function.

=cut





=head2 pdl_symbols

  Signature: (widget; x(); y(); N_points(); orientation(); filled(); size(); skip(); properties)

=for ref

Draws a wide variety of symbols centered at (x, y).

Applicable properties include colors, backColors, clipRects, fillPatterns,
fillWindings, lineEnds, linePatterns, lineWidths, rops, rop2s, and translates.

Through various combinations of C<N_points>, C<filled>, and C<skip>, you can
generate many different regular symbols, including dashes, stars, asterisks,
triangles, and diamonds. You can also specify each symbol's C<size> and
C<orientation>. The size is the radius of a circle that would circumscribe
the shape. The orientation is... well... just keep reading.

The shape drawn depends on C<N_points>. If C<N_points> is:

=over

=item zero or one

This will draw a circle with a radius of the
given size. The circle will be filled or not based on the value passed for
C<filled>, but the C<orientation> and C<skip> parameters are ignored. This
is almost redundant compared with the ellipse functions, except that this
arrangement makes it very easy to thead over filled/not-filled, and you
cannot specify an eccentricity for your points using C<pdl_symbols>.

=item two

This will draw a line centered at (x, y) and with a length of 2*C<size>.
The C<orientation> is measured in degrees, starting from horizontal, with
increasing angles rotating the line counter-clockwise. The value for C<skip>
is ignored.

This is particulary useful for visualizing slope-fields (although calculating
the angles for the slope field is surprisingly tricky).

=item three or more

This will draw a shape related to a regular polygon with the specified
number of sides. Precisely what kind of polygon it draws is based on the
value of C<skip>. For example, a five-sided polygon with a C<skip> of one
would give you a pentagon:


                           second point
                               _
               third   __..--'' \
               point  |          \
                      |           \
                      |            \  first
                      |            /  point
                      |           /
                      |__        /
              fourth     ``--.._/
              point
                           fifth point

                           skip = 1

In contrast, a five-sided polygon with a skip of 2 will give you a star:

                           fourth point
                           
              second          /|                
              point   \`~.._/  |            
                       `\ / `--|.__          
                         X     | __>  first point       
                       ,/ \_,--|'                
              fifth   /_~'' \  |                 
              point           \|
                            
                           third point
 
                           skip = 2

A skip of three would give visually identical results but the actual order
in which the vertices are drawn is different:

                           third point
                           
              fifth           /|                
              point   \`~.._/  |            
                       `\ / `--|.__          
                         X     | __>  first point       
                       ,/ \_,--|'                
              second  /_~'' \  |                 
              point           \|
                            
                           fourth point
 
                           skip = 3

A skip of zero is a special case, and means I<draw lines to each point from
the center.> In other words, create an asterisk:

                           second point
                               
               third            /
               point   `.      / 
                         `.   /   
                           `./_______  first
                           .'\         point
                         .'   \
                       .'      \
              fourth            \
              point
                           fifth point
 
                           skip = 0

In summary, a C<skip> of zero gives you an N-asterisk. A C<skip> of one gives
you a regular polygon. A C<skip> of two gives you a star. And so forth.
Higher values of C<skip> are allowed; they simply add to the winding behavior.

Specifying the orientation changes the position of the first point and,
therefore, all subsequent points. A positive orientation rotates the first
point counter-clockwise by the specified number of degrees. Obviously, due
to the symmetry of the shapes, rotations of 360 / N_points look identical to
not performing any rotation.

For all nonzero values of C<skip>, specifying a fill will end up with
a filled shape instead of a line drawing.

=back

By default, filled stars and other symbols with odd numbers of points have a
hole in their middle. However, Prima provides a means for indicating that you
want such shapes filled; that is the C<fillWinding> property. As with almost all
graphical properties, you can specify the C<fillWinding> property for each
symbol by specifying the C<fillWindings> piddle.

This example creates a table of shapes. It uses an argument from the command
line to determine the line width.

=for example

 use PDL::NiceSlice;
 
 # Generate a table of shapes:
 my @dims = (40, 1, 30);
 my $N_points = xvals(@dims)->clump(2) + 1;
 my $orientation = 0;
 my $filled = yvals(@dims)->clump(2) + 1;
 my $size = 10;
 my $skip = zvals(@dims)->clump(2);
 my $x = $N_points->xvals * 25 + 25;
 my $y = $N_points->yvals * 25 + 25;
 my $lineWidths = $ARGV[0] || 1;
 
 # Draw them:
 $canvas->pdl_symbols($x, $y, $N_points, 0, $filled, 10, $skip

=for bad

Bad values are handled by C<pdl_symbols>. If any of the values you pass in
are bad, the symbol is not drawn at that x/y coordinate.



=for bad

pdl_symbols processes bad values.
It will set the bad-value flag of all output piddles if the flag is set for any of the input piddles.

=head1 ERROR MESSAGE

These functions may throw the following exception:

=head2 Your widget must be derived from Prima::Drawable

This means that you tried to draw on something that is not a Prima::Drawable
object, or a class derived from it. I don't know enough about the Prima
internals to know if that has any hope of working, but why do it in the first
place?

=head1 PDL::PP DETAILS

Those well versed in PDL::PP might ask how I manage to produce pdlified methods
that take variable numbers of arguments. That is a long story, and it is told in
the volumes of comments in pdlprima.pd. Give it a read if you want to know what
goes on behind the scenes.

=item Full Drawabel API

I would like a PDL function for every drawable function in the API.
Prima Drawable functions that currently do not have an equivalent PDL
implementation include L<Prima::Drawable/draw_text>,
L<Prima::Drawable/fill_spline>, L<Prima::Drawable/put_image>,
L<Prima::Drawable/put_image_indirect>, L<Prima::Drawable/rect3d>,
L<Prima::Drawable/rect_focus>, L<Prima::Drawable/spline>,
L<Prima::Drawable/stretch_image>, and L<Prima::Drawable/text_out>

=item Bad Value Support

Bad values are handled decently in L</polylines> and L</fillpolys>, but not for
the other functions. Bad x/y values should be skipped for almost all the drawing
primitives, but what about bad colors for valid coordinates? I could not draw
the primitive, defer to the widget's default color, or use the value associated
with the singular key (i.e. C<color>). But I haven't decided which of these is
best.
