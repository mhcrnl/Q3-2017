Guido RELEASE HISTORY

Guido 0.51

RELEASE NOTES

This minor release is meant to fix a few problems with the installation
process.

* Instructions related to the setup of a pre-downloaded distribution were
	incomplete and confusing

* The installer was also incapable of installing a pre-downloaded dist, so
	that has been worked on, as well.

Guido 0.50

RELEASE NOTES

This release of Guido adds:

* A more realistic version number.  We were not updating the version as we 
	should	have, so I have opted for 0.5 instead of 0.05.  Guido is still 
	not ready for a major release yet, but it is certainly beyond the 
	interesting toy stage.

* An improved setup routine that will update existing Guido installations

* The property manager now shows property values even if they are the default
	values.  It also has a new "default" checkbox which can be checked off
	to set the value back to its default

* Some better initial values for the configuration files

* The Toolbox now retains the defaults for each widget, so you can set up 
	reasonable defaults for your widgets.  (Try right clicking a widget
	in the Toolbox and choosing "Defaults" from the popup menu)

Guido 0.04

RELEASE NOTES

Many changes in this release, primarily drag and drop support and improved support for putting widgets inside widgets.  Bugs fixes in the Property Page have also made that feature more robust, as well.  You're welcome to peruse the changelog for details, of which you will find plenty.

Also, I have improved the POD documentation throughout.
