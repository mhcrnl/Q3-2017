Setting up Guido:

There are currently 2 good ways to install Guido.  In the order of preference, they are:

1. Use the automated installer.  
	A. The installer requires a working installation of CPAN or the 
	Perl Package Manager (PPM is preferred for Win32 plaforms,
	CPAN for others.)  See the appropriate documentation for setting up 
	those systems.

	B. Go to http://guido.sf.net/guido_now.php and it will automatically 
	send you to the correct current release of the installer.  Download and 
	run the script, answering the questions as the install progresses.

2. Get a copy of the latest release distribution package and use it to install.
	A. Go to http://guido.sf.net/guido_dist.php and it will automatically send 
	you to the current release of the distribution (tar.gz format).  For the 
	zip format, go to http://guido.sf.net/guido_zip_dist.php.
	Expand the distribution into a temporary directory.

	B. Run setup.pl in the distribution directory and let it handle the installation.

You should now be able to enter "perl guido.pl" while in the bin subdirectory and Guido should run. 
If it doesn't, it's a bug and you can report the errors you get at the Guido project site:

Thanks for giving Guido a try!
