<h1>Working With Projects</h1>
<p>The largest manageable unit in Guido is the Project.  A Project is made up
of files of many sorts:  source files, required files, support files, and used
files.  Due to Guido's extensible nature, an infinite number of other potential
file types might also be managed by a Project.  A Project itself can be saved,
loaded, and collated into Perl code.  We refer to the process of creating Perl
code as "collation" to differentiate it from "compilation" which, in other
languages, creates a binary executible.  Note that only information about the
names and locations of the files a Project manages are saved in the Project's
file, not the data that is part of the files themselves.  </p>

<p>Projects are managed by a Guido plug-in which is aptly named the "Project
Manager."  It appears (in the default Guido configuration) on the left-hand side
of the main Guido window, and displays the list of open projects and the files
they are managing.  Often these file listings will have context-sensitive menus
that you can bring up by right clicking on files in the listing.</p>

<h2>Creating a New Project</h2>

<p>To create a project in Guido, choose the File->Project->New Project menu
option.  At this point, you should see a dialog box like this:</p>


<p align="center">

</p>

<p>To create your new project, simply choose the project type, give a name for
your project, and indicate where Guido should create the project directory for
your project.  Currently project types of TkApp and TkWidget are supported.
TkApp projects are intended for creating standalone Perl/Tk applications that
run as perl scripts.  Their target "collation" files are Perl scripts.
TkWidgets, on the other hand, are intended to become Perl/Tk extensions suitable
for uploading to CPAN.  They are good for situations when you know that some of
your Tk GUI could be re-used in other projects, or might be useful to other
developers through CPAN.</p>

<p>One note about the project directory:  Guido will create the directory for
you.  If you have a pre-created directory, it must be the same name as the
project, and you should enter its <em>parent</em> directory in the entry box.
So if you had a project named "Qwerty" and the directory already existed in the
/home/me/projects/Qwerty directory, you would enter /home/me/projects in the
entry box.</p>

<p>Once you've entered the information, click "OK" and Guido will prepare the
directory for you.  Most project types will create a new project file, a
beginning SourceFile (a TkForm file in the case of a TkApp project), and some
other supporting files, such as an events file for putting event handler code
into.</p>

<p>At this point you're ready to start working on the Project.</p>

<h2>Opening Pre-Existing Projects</h2>

<p>If you've closed Guido and are back for another session, you'll need to know
how to open a pre-existing project (unless you have Guido configured to
automatically load your last project).  The process is, again, quite simple.  If
you've recently used the project you want to open, you might check the
File->Recent Files list to see if it's there.  If it isn't, you can choose the
File->Project->Open Project menu option, and you should be presented with the
familiar "Open File" dialog box:</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="images/projects-open.jpg" width="422" height="283" alt="Guido Open Project Dialog" align="middle"><BR>
Open Project Dialog Box
</p>

<p>Find the project file you wish to load (it will have a .gpj extension) and then click "OK."

<h2>Viewing/Changing a Project's Properties</h2>

<p>The properties of a project can be viewed in the middle of the main Guido 
window if you click on the name of the Project in the "Project Manager."
Modifying the values of the listed properties will actually change the values in
the project itself.  Changing a project's properties is not advised at this
point in Guido's development.  At some point prior to our first major release, a
project will be able to adapt to changes in its properties.
