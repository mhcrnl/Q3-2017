<h1>Working With Source Files</h1>

<p>In Guido, a Source File represents a self-contained piece of a project.  
Source files are accessed via the Project Manager plugin , and can be opened in
the configured editor (see <a href="configuring.html">Configuration</a>), or in
the FormBuilder if they are GUI source files.  Certain properties of source
files can be modified in the Property Editor.  The properties of a source file
will be made editable in the Property Editor when the source file is selected in
the Property Manager's file listing.</p>

<p>The most common source file is a GUI source file such as a TkForm or
TkComposite.  TkForms represent a Tk window that is not expected to be embedded
in another window.  A Tk composite is very much like a TkForm except it is
intended to be embedded into another TkForm.</p>

<p>Other types of non-GUI source files can be edited in their respective
editors, as configured by their MIME type (see <a
href="configuring.html">Configuration</a>).</p>
