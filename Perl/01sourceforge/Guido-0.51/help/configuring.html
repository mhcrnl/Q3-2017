<h1>Configuring/Customizing</h1>

<p>Guido can be configured and customized in many ways, some of which are not currently accessible from the IDE.
This section will concentrate on the ways that its behavior can be modified through the GUI.  Future releases will either
document the manual configuration options, or provide the ability to make changes directly from the IDE.</p>

<p>To make configuration changes through the Guido IDE, choose the Utilities->Edit Configuration menu option.  A dialog
box will be displayed with tabs grouping settings into various categories.</p>

<p>The following tabs allow you to modify the configuration:</p>

<h2>General</h2>

<ul>
<li>Startup Geometry: Allows you to define the default size and position of the main Guido window on startup.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Memory</h2>

<ul>
<li>Max Recent Files:  Set the maximum number of files to display in the File->Recent Files list</li>
<li>Remember Last Geometry: When set, will cause Guido to remember the last size and position of the main Guido
window the next time it is run.</li>
<li>Remember Last Project(s): When set, will cause Guido to automatically load the projects that were open when it
was last shut down.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Plugins</h2>

<p>The Plugins configuration tab allows you to modify the way the Guido plugins are presented (or not presented).  At this time, modifying
the plugin display configurations might be considered a bit risky, since the layout is based on the Perl/Tk "pack" geometry manager and the
parameters used to create the default display might be a little confusing to the beginning Perl/Tk programmer.  If you think you know what
you're doing, however, feel free to play around with the configuration.  Just keep a backup of your guido_config.cfg and you should be fine!</p>

<ul>
<li>Hide/Pack Settings:  Checking the "hide" button will cause a plugin to be loaded at startup, but not packed into the display.  Note that the
FormBuilder plugin is not meant to be displayed, so it is automatically hidden in the default configuration.  The Pack Settings should look
familiar to Perl/Tk programmers, although the format may be odd.  They are the parameters that will be passed to the pack command when
the plugin is packed into the display.  The format is "param=value;param=value", which will be familiar to anyone who has used ODBC
connection strings before...</li>

<li>Add/Remove Selected:  The Add and Remove Selected buttons allow you to register new plugins and remove registered ones.  Adding a
plugin requires you to specify the Perl package name, which should leave off the "Guido::Plugin" portion (all plugins must inherit from
Guido::Plugin, but don't necessary have to be in that namespace).  The "Display Name" is also specified, and can be anything you want.
  Currently, Guido might have some serious errors if you remove the default plugins from the system, but we hope to soon define some
  functionality specifications that allow Guido to degrade gracefully if you remove vital plugins.  This would also allow you to drop in
  replacements for the default plugins if you create or find better ones.  Removing plugins is as easy as selecting the one you want to remove
  from the list of available ones, and then clicking "Remove Selected".</li>
</ul>

<h2>Macros</h2>

<p>Macros are simply Perl packages of functions that are meant to perform operations in the running Guido application.  For information on
programming macros, see the Programmer's Documentation and look in the Macro Writing section.</p>

<h2>ToolBox</h2>

<p>If the Toolbox Plugin has been defined in the Plugins area of the Configuration Dialog, then this tab should appear.  It allows you to specify
the path that the Toolbox will look for icons.  The default is usually the best to use, and you can simply add new icons to the directory.</p>

<h2>FormBuilder</h2>

<p>If the FormBuilder Plugin has been defined in the Plugins area of the Configuration Dialog, then this tab should appear.  It allows you to specify
the default widget type that will be used when adding widgets to the current form.  At this stage in Guido's development, this option really shouldn't
be changed unless you are a developer doing some testing.</p>


<h2>Executor</h2>

<p>If the FormBuilder Plugin has been defined in the Plugins area of the Configuration Dialog, then this tab should appear.  It allows you to specify
mime-types for files that you expect Guido to be handling, and the mapping of file extensions to those mime-types.  This is where you can set
up your favorite text editor as the handler for perl source files so that Guido will start it up when those files need to be edited.  In future releases,
the Executor plugin will likely try your operating system's own mime-type mapping system (if it has one) when a mime-type is not specified in
the configuration.</p>
