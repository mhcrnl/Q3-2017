<h1>Guido User Guide</h1>
<p>Guido (Graphical User Interface Development Objects) is a Perl/Tk
application for creating Perl/Tk applications and extensions.  It presents
itself to the developer through the typical IDE (Integrated Development
Environment) interface by defining projects that are made up of files and then
allowing operations on them.  It borrows many concepts from other popular IDEs,
such as Visual Basic, Visual Studio, KDevelop,  et al.</p>

<p>One of Guido's main ideas is that you should be able to use as little or as
much of it as you wish.  For example, if all you want is some Perl code that
creates a quick Tk window with some widgets on it, you shouldn't have to go to
the trouble of compiling an enormous project full of files that only Guido knows
anything about.  You also shouldn't have to abandon your own favorite editor in
order to relearn the keystrokes and navigation for yet another integrated
editor.  But along those same lines, you should be able to use Guido to create
an entire application and prepare it for distribution.  In its current pre-alpha
state, Guido succeeds at least marginally in reaching these goals.</p>

<p>Before you can begin using Guido, it must be "installed" and at least
minimally configured.  For installation, please refer to the <a
href="../INSTALL">INSTALL</a> document that is in the root of the Guido
distribution.  For configuration, see the following help file:</p>

<p>The following help files will take you through the various Guido functions,
progressing from the creation of a new project to the collation of the project
into running Perl code.</p>
