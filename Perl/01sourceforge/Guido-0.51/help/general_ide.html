<h1>General Guido IDE Concepts</h1>

<p>The Guido IDE borrows from many popular IDEs and adds what are hopefully a
few new ideas to the mix.  The main parts of the Guido IDE should be familiar to
anyone who has used a modern GUI application recently.  The main parts of the
application are the Menu Bar, Tool Bar, and the Plugin Space.  Although the Menu
Bar, Tool Bar, and the layout of the Plugin Space can be modified through
Guido's configuration functions, this discussion will assume that the layout has
not been customized.  Because the Menu Bar and Toolbar follow standard
conventions in GUI design (for the most part), we will concentrate on the Plugin
Space and the default Guido plugins that use it.

<h2>The Project Manager</h2>

<p>The Project Manager presents an heirarchical list of the currently open
projects and the files that each uses.  The files are categorized based on
function.  It makes extensive use of context-sensitive menus, so right clicking
on items in the lists usually provides a menu of possible functions one can
perform.</p>

<h2>The Property Manager</h2>

<p>The Property Manager provides a way to easily view and edit the properties
of many types of Guido objects, including projects, GUI forms, and individual
widgets.  Changes to properties become effective as soon as the focus moves away
from the entry field.</p>

<h2>The Form Builder</h2>

<p>The Form Builder is Guido's default way of visually building a GUI for
either an application window or a Tk "mega" widget.  The developer uses the
Widget Box to add individual widgets to the GUI and the Property Editor to
change the properties.</p>

<h2>The Widget Box</h2>

<p>The Widget Box provides a selection of widgets for adding to a form or
widget that is being managed by the Form Builder.  Clicking a widget causes it
to be added to the GUI.  Right clicking on the Widget Box allows one to add and
remove items from the Widget Box.</p>
