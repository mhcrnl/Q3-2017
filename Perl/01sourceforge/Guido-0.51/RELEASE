Guido 0.51

RELEASE NOTES

This minor release is meant to fix a few problems with the installation
process.

* Instructions related to the setup of a pre-downloaded distribution were
	incomplete and confusing

* The installer was also incapable of installing a pre-downloaded dist, so
	that has been worked on, as well.
