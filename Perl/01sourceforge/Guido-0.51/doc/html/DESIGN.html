</A></H2>

<P>Guido primary goal should be to provide a flexible and easily extensible 
interface for developing graphical user interfaces using Perl.  This goal takes 
precendence over all else, and must be a fulfilled goal from the first pre-alpha 
version right up to its final release.  No design decision can be allowed to 
negate this goal.  

</P>
<P>A secondary goal of Guido's design should be to take into account the limited 
foresight of its developers, and provide the ability to extend the original 
design without having to rewrite the core.

</P><H2><A NAME="Design%20Guidelines">Design Guidelines

</A></H2>

<P>To achieve these goals, we will use the following directives as our guidelines 
for Guido's design:

</P><DL><DT><A NAME="*%20Guido's%20primary%20focus%20should%20be%20on%20providing%20an%20easy%20to%20use%20GUI%20design%20%0atool%2c%20and%20generating%20complete%20Perl%20applications%20from%20the%20designs%20a%20user%20creates.">* Guido's primary focus should be on providing an easy to use GUI design 
tool, and generating complete Perl applications from the designs a user creates.

<DT><A NAME="*%20Guido%20should%20use%20a%20%22document%2fview%22%20strategy%20to%20segregate%20data%20from%20%0apresentation.">* Guido should use a &quot;document/view&quot; strategy to segregate data from 
presentation.

</DD>
<DT><A NAME="*%20Guido%20should%20use%20a%20plugin%20architecture%20to%20provide%20extensibility.">* Guido should use a plugin architecture to provide extensibility.

<DT><A NAME="*%20Guido%20should%20take%20advantage%20of%20object%20oriented%20development%20whenever%20%0apossible%20to%20allow%20flexibility%20and%20encapsulate%20functionality.">* Guido should take advantage of object oriented development whenever 
possible to allow flexibility and encapsulate functionality.

<DT><A NAME="*%20Guido%20should%20expose%20a%20clear%20Application%20Programming%20Interface%20(API)%20for%20%0adevelopers.">* Guido should expose a clear Application Programming Interface (API) for 
developers.

which is immediately familiar to a developer through experience gained from 
other developer tools.

<H2><A NAME="General%20Design%20Structure">General Design Structure

</A></H2>

<P>Guido's general design should follow this structure:

</P>
<P>=over4

</P>
<P>=item* Core code is centralized in non-GUI-dependent objects (as much as 
possible)

</P>
<P>=item* Plug-ins provide visual representation of core data

</P>
<P>=item* Built-in plugins provide default functionality, but can be overridden or 
extended by custom-written plugins

</P>
<P>=item* Data structures and data files (such as project files and GUI spec files) 
will be initialized from templates that the user can modify based on pre-defined rules.

</P>
