A few tips on how to get started as a contributor to the Guido project.  You don't have to be a Perl programmer to do it!  You can provide web design, editorial, or even QA testing.  Did we mention that money is acceptable, too? ;-)

It is generated by creating comments in the pm files and using utilities from another SourceForge project called ModInfo.  See http://www.sf.net/projects/modinfo for more information.
