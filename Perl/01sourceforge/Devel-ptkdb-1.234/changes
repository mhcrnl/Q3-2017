1.1083
~~~~~
A perl debugger package is required to define a subroutine name 'sub'. 
This routine is a 'proxy' for handling subroutine calls and allows the
debugger pacakage to track subroutine depth so that it can implement
'step over', 'step in' and 'return' functionality.  It must also handle
the same context as the proxied routine; it must return a scalar where a
scalar was being expected, an array where an array is being expected and
a void where a void was being expected.  Ptkdb was not handling the case
for void.  99.9% of the time this will have no ill effects although it
is being handled incorrectly.
