This package is a part of the Chez.com ToolKit for personnal web pages
hosting service.

This package provides functions to deal with templates in Perl. It
also provides other functions to do log, to get value from db-file
(Btree or Hash) and to get the date.  The principle of the templates
handling is to use an HTTP server to serve the templates. There's also
a cache handling to speed up templates loading and to have a copy in
case of a crash of the templates server.
