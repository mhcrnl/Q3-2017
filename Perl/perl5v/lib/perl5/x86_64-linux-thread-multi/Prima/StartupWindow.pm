=head1 NAME

Prima::StartupWindow - a simplistic startup banner window

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The module, when imported by C<use> call, creates a temporary window
which appears with 'loading...' text while the modules required by
a program are loading. The window parameters can be modified by
passing custom parameters after C<use Prima::StartupWindow> statement,
which are passed to C<Prima::Window> class as creation parameters.
The window is discarded by explicit unimporting of the module
( see L<"SYNOPSIS">  ).

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Prima;
	use Prima::Application;
	use Prima::StartupWindow; # the window is created here

	use Prima::Buttons;
	.... # lots of 'use' of other modules

	no Prima::StartupWindow; # the window is discarded here
