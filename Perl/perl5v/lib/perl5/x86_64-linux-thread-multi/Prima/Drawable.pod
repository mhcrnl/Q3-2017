=head1 NAME

Prima::Drawable - 2-D graphic interface

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   if ( $object-> isa('Prima::Drawable')) {
        $object-> begin_paint;
	$object-> color( cl::Black);
	$object-> line( 100, 100, 200, 200);
	$object-> ellipse( 100, 100, 200, 200);
        $object-> end_paint;
   }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Prima::Drawable is a descendant of Prima::Component.
It provides access to the object-bound graphic context and canvas
through its methods and properties. The Prima::Drawable
descendants Prima::Widget, Prima::Image, Prima::DeviceBitmap
and Prima::Printer are backed by system-dependent routines
that allow drawing and painting on the system objects.

=head1 USAGE

Prima::Drawable, as well as its ancestors Prima::Component and
Prima::Object, is never used directly, because Prima::Drawable class
by itself provides only the interface. It provides a
three-state object access - when drawing and painting is enabled,
when these are disabled, and the information acquisition state. 
By default, the object is created in paint-disabled state. To 
switch to the enabled state, begin_paint() method is used. Once in the enabled state,
the object drawing and painting methods apply to the object-bound canvas.
To return to the disabled state, end_paint() method is called.
The information state can be managed by using 
begin_paint_info() and end_paint_info() methods pair. An object
cannot be triggered from the information state
to the enabled state ( and vice versa ) directly.
These states differ on how do they apply to a graphic context and
a canvas.

=head2 Graphic context and canvas

The graphic context is the set of variables, that control how exactly
graphic primitives are rendered. The variable examples are color, font,
line width, etc.
Another term used here is 'canvas' - the graphic area of a certain extent,
bound to the object, where the drawing and painting methods are applied to.

In all three states a graphic context is allowed to be modified, but
in different ways.
In the disabled state the graphic context values form a template values;
when a object enters the information or the enabled state, the values
are preserved, but when the object is back to the disabled state,
the graphic context is restored to the values last assigned before entering
new state. The code example below illustrates the idea:

   $d = Prima::Drawable-> create;
   $d-> lineWidth( 5);
   $d-> begin_paint_info;
   # lineWidth is 5 here
   $d-> lineWidth( 1);
   # lineWidth is 1 
   $d-> end_paint_info;
   # lineWidth is 5 again

( Note: C<::region>, C<::clipRect> and C<::translate> properties are exceptions. 
They can not be used in the disabled state; their values are neither 
recorded nor used as a template).

That is, in disabled state any Drawable maintains only the graphic context.
To draw on a canvas, the object must enter the enabled state by calling begin_paint().
This function can be unsuccessful, because the object binds with system resources
during this stage, and might fail. Only after the enabled state is entered, 
the canvas is accessible:

   $d = Prima::Image-> create( width => 100, height => 100);
   if ( $d-> begin_paint) {
      $d-> color( cl::Black);
      $d-> bar( 0, 0, $d-> size);
      $d-> color( cl::White);
      $d-> fill_ellipse( $d-> width / 2, $d-> height / 2, 30, 30);
      $d-> end_paint;
   } else {
      die "can't draw on image:$@";
   }

Different objects are mapped to different types of canvases -
Prima::Image canvas pertains its content after end_paint(),
Prima::Widget maps it to a screen area, which content is of 
more transitory nature, etc.

The information state is as same as the enabled state, but the changes to
a canvas are not visible. Its sole purpose is to read, not to write information.
Because begin_paint() requires some amount of system resources, there is
a chance that a resource request can fail, for any reason. The begin_paint_info()
requires some resources as well, but usually much less, and therefore
if only information is desired, it is usually faster and cheaper to
obtain it inside the information state. A notable example is
get_text_width() method, that returns the length of a text string in pixels.
It works in both enabled and information states, but code

   $d = Prima::Image-> create( width => 10000, height => 10000);
   $d-> begin_paint;
   $x = $d-> get_text_width('A');
   $d-> end_paint;

is much more 'expensive' than 

   $d = Prima::Image-> create( width => 10000, height => 10000);
   $d-> begin_paint_info;
   $x = $d-> get_text_width('A');
   $d-> end_paint_info;

for the obvious reasons.

It must be noted that some information methods like get_text_width()
work even under the disabled state; the object is switched to
the information state implicitly if it is necessary.

=head2 Color space

Graphic context and canvas operations rely completely
on a system implementation. The internal canvas color representation
is therefore system-specific, and usually could not be described
in standard definitions. Often the only information available 
about color space is its color depth.

Therefore, all color manipulations, including dithering and
antialiasing are subject to system implementation, and can not
be controlled from perl code. When a property is set in the object 
disabled state, it is recorded verbatim; color properties 
are no exception. After the object switched to the enabled
state, a color value is transformed to a system color representation, 
which might be different from Prima's. For example, if a display color depth is 15 bits,
5 bits for every component, then white color value 0xffffff
is mapped to

 11111000 11111000 11111000
 --R----- --G----- --B-----

that equals to 0xf8f8f8, not 0xffffff ( See L<Prima::gp-problems> for
inevident graphic issues discussion ).

The Prima::Drawable color format is RRGGBB, with each component
resolution of 8 bit, thus allowing 2^24 color combinations. If the device color space
depth is different, the color is truncated or expanded automatically. In
case the device color depth is small, dithering algorithms might apply.

Note: not only color properties, but all graphic context properties
allow all possible values in the disabled state, which transformed into
system-allowed values in the enabled and the information states. 
This feature can be used to test if a graphic device is capable of 
performing certain operations ( for example,
if it supports raster operations - the printers usually do not ). Example:

  $d-> begin_paint;
  $d-> rop( rop::Or);
  if ( $d-> rop != rop::Or) { # this assertion is always false without 
     ...                      # begin_paint/end_paint brackets
  }
  $d-> end_paint;

There are ( at least ) two color properties on each drawable -
C<::color> and C<::backColor>. The values they operate are integers 
in the discussed above RRGGBB format, however, the toolkit defines 
some mnemonic color constants:

  cl::Black
  cl::Blue
  cl::Green
  cl::Cyan
  cl::Red
  cl::Magenta
  cl::Brown
  cl::LightGray
  cl::DarkGray
  cl::LightBlue
  cl::LightGreen
  cl::LightCyan
  cl::LightRed
  cl::LightMagenta
  cl::Yellow
  cl::White
  cl::Gray

As stated before, it is not unlikely that if a device color depth
is small, the primitives plotted in particular colors
will be drawn with dithered or incorrect colors. This usually happens
on paletted displays, with 256 or less colors.

There exists two methods that facilitate the correct color representation.
The first way is to get as much information as possible about the device.
The methods get_nearest_color() and get_physical_palette()
provide possibility to avoid mixed colors drawing by obtaining 
indirect information about solid colors, supported by a device.
Another method is to use C<::palette> property. It works by inserting
the colors into the system palette, so if an application
knows the colors it needs beforehand, it can employ this method - however
this might result in system palette flash when a window focus toggles.

Both of these methods are applicable both with drawing routines and image output.
An image desired to output with least distortion is advised to
export its palette to an output device, because images usually are not 
subject to automatic dithering algorithms. Prima::ImageViewer module
employs this scheme.

=head2 Monochrome bitmaps

A special case of C<put_image> is taken where the object to be drawn is a
monochrome DeviceBitmap object. This object doesn't possess the color palette,
and is by definition a bitmap, where there are only two values present, 0s and
1s. When it is drawn, 0s are drawn with the color value of the target canvas
C<color> property, and 1s with C<backColor>.

This means that the following code

    $bitmap-> color(0);
    $bitmap-> line(0,0,100,100);
    $target-> color(cl::Green);
    $target-> put_image(0,0,$bitmap);

produces a green line on C<$target>.

When using monochrome bitmaps for logical operations, note that target colors
should not be explicit 0 and 0xffffff, nor C<cl::Black> and C<cl::White>, but
C<cl::Clear> and C<cl::Set> instead. The reason is that on paletted displays,
system palette may not necessarily contain the white color under palette index
(2^ScreenDepth-1). C<cl::Set> thus signals that the value should be "all ones",
no matter what color it represents, because it will be used for logical
operations.

=head2 Fonts

Prima maintains its own font naming convention, that
usually does not conform to system's. Since its goal
is interoperability, it might be so that some system fonts
would not be accessible from within the toolkit. 

Prima::Drawable provides property C<::font>, that accepts/returns a hash, 
that represents the state of a font in the object-bound graphic context. 
The font hash keys that are acceptable on set-call are:

=over 4

=item name

The font name string. If there is no such font, 
a default font name is used. To select default font,
a 'Default' string can be passed with the same result
( unless the system has a font named 'Default', of course).

=item height

An integer value from 1 to MAX_INT. Specifies the desired
extent of a font glyph between descent and ascent lines in pixels.

=item size

An integer value from 1 to MAX_INT. Specifies the desired
extent of a font glyph between descent and internal leading lines in 
points. The relation between C<size> and C<height> is

            height - internal_leading 
  size =  --------------------------- * 72.27
                 resolution

That differs from some other system representations:
Win32, for example, rounds 72.27 constant to 72.

=item width

A integer value from 0 to MAX_INT. If greater than 0, specifies the desired
extent of a font glyph width in pixels. If 0, sets the default ( designed )
width corresponding to the font size or height.

=item style

A combination of C<fs::> ( font style ) constants. The constants hight

   fs::Normal 
   fs::Bold
   fs::Thin
   fs::Italic
   fs::Underlined
   fs::StruckOut
   fs::Outline

and can be OR-ed together to express the font style. 
fs::Normal equals to 0 and usually never used.
If some styles are not supported by a system-dependent font subsystem,
they are ignored.

=item pitch

A one of three constants:

   fp::Default
   fp::Fixed
   fp::Variable

fp::Default specifies no interest about font pitch selection.
fp::Fixed is set when a monospaced (all glyphs are of same width) font 
is desired. fp::Variable pitch
specifies a font with different glyph widths. This key
is of the highest priority; all other keys may be altered for
the consistency of the pitch key.

=item direction

A counter-clockwise rotation angle - 0 is default, 90 is pi/2, 180 is pi, etc.
If a font could not be rotated, it is usually substituted to the one that can.

=item encoding

A string value, one of the strings returned by 
C<Prima::Application::font_encodings>. Selects desired font
encoding; if empty, picks the first matched encoding, preferably
the locale set up by the user.

The encodings provided by different systems are different;
in addition, the only encodings are recognizable by the system,
that are represented by at least one font in the system.

Unix systems and the toolkit PostScript interface usually 
provide the following encodings:

   iso8859-1
   iso8859-2
   ... other iso8859 ...
   fontspecific

Win32 returns the literal strings like

   Western
   Baltic
   Cyrillic
   Hebrew
   Symbol

=back

A hash that C<::font> returns, is a tied hash, whose
keys are also available as separate properties.
For example, 

   $x = $d-> font-> {style};

is equivalent to

   $x = $d-> font-> style;

While the latter gives nothing but the arguable coding convenience, its
usage in set-call is much more usable:

   $d-> font-> style( fs::Bold);

instead of

   my %temp = %{$d-> font};
   $temp{ style} = fs::Bold;
   $d-> font( \%temp);

The properties of a font tied hash are also accessible through set() call, 
like in Prima::Object:

   $d-> font-> style( fs::Bold);
   $d-> font-> width( 10);

is adequate to

   $d-> font-> set(
      style => fs::Bold,
      width => 10,
   );

When get-called, C<::font> property returns a hash where
more entries than the described above can be found. These keys
are read-only, their values are discarded if passed to C<::font> 
in a set-call.

In order to query the full list of fonts available to
a graphic device, a C<::fonts> method is used. This method is
not present in Prima::Drawable namespace; it can be found in two
built-in class instances, C<Prima::Application> and C<Prima::Printer>.

C<Prima::Application::fonts> returns metrics for the fonts available to
a screen device, while C<Prima::Printer::fonts> ( or its substitute Prima::PS::Printer )
returns fonts for the printing device. The result of this method is an
array of font metrics, fully analogous to these 
returned by C<Prima::Drawable::font> method. 

=over 4

=item family

A string with font family name. The family is a 
secondary string key, used for distinguishing between
fonts with same name but of different vendors ( for example,
Adobe Courier and Microsoft Courier).

=item vector

A boolean; true if the font is vector ( e.g. can be scaled
with no quality loss ), false otherwise. The false value
does not show if the font can be scaled at all - the behavior
is system-dependent. Win32 can scale all non-vector fonts;
X11 only the fonts specified as the scalable.

=item ascent

Number of pixels between a glyph baseline and descent line.

=item descent

Number of pixels between a glyph baseline and descent line.

=item internalLeading

Number of pixels between ascent and internal leading lines.
Negative if the ascent line is below the internal leading line.

=item externalLeading

Number of pixels between ascent and external leading lines.
Negative if the ascent line is above the external leading line.

   fw::UltraLight
   fw::ExtraLight
   fw::Light

   fw::Medium
   fw::SemiBold
   fw::Bold
   fw::ExtraBold
   fw::UltraBold

constants.

monospaced fonts.

=item xDeviceRes

Designed horizontal font resolution in dpi.

=item yDeviceRes

Designed vertical font resolution in dpi.

=item firstChar

Index of the first glyph present in a font.

=item lastChar

Index of the last glyph present in a font.

=item breakChar

Index of the default character used to divide words.
In a typical western language font it is 32, ASCII space character.

=item defaultChar

Index of a glyph that is drawn instead of nonexistent
glyph if its index is passed to the text drawing routines.

=back

=head2 Font ABC metrics

Besides these characteristics, every font glyph has an ABC-metric,
the three integer values that describe horizontal extents of a
glyph's black part relative to the glyph extent:

A and C are negative, if a glyphs 'hangs' over it neighbors, 
as shown in picture on the left. A and C values are positive, if a glyph contains 
empty space in front or behind the neighbor glyphs, like in picture on the right. 
As can be seen, B is the width of a glyph's black part.

ABC metrics returned by get_font_abc() method.

=head2 Raster operations

A drawable has two raster operation properties: C<::rop> and C<::rop2>.
These define how the graphic primitives are plotted. C<::rop> deals
with the foreground color drawing, and C<::rop2> with the background.

The toolkit defines the following operations:

   rop::Blackness      #   = 0 
   rop::NotOr          #   = !(src | dest) 
   rop::NotSrcAnd      #  &= !src 
   rop::NotPut         #   = !src 
   rop::NotDestAnd     #   = !dest & src 
   rop::Invert         #   = !dest 
   rop::XorPut         #  ^= src 
   rop::NotAnd         #   = !(src & dest) 
   rop::AndPut         #  &= src 
   rop::NotXor         #   = !(src ^ dest) 
   rop::NotSrcXor      #     alias for rop::NotXor
   rop::NotDestXor     #     alias for rop::NotXor
   rop::NoOper         #   = dest 
   rop::NotSrcOr       #  |= !src 
   rop::CopyPut        #   = src 
   rop::NotDestOr      #   = !dest | src 
   rop::OrPut          #  |= src 
   rop::Whiteness      #   = 1 

Usually, however, graphic devices support only a small part
of the above set, limiting C<::rop> to the most important operations:
Copy, And, Or, Xor, NoOp. C<::rop2> is usually even more restricted,
supports only Copy and NoOp.

The raster operations apply to all graphic primitives except SetPixel.

=head2 Coordinates

The Prima toolkit employs a geometrical XY grid, where
X ascends rightwards and Y ascends upwards. There, the (0,0)
location is the bottom-left pixel of a canvas.

All graphic primitives use inclusive-inclusive boundaries.
For example,

   $d-> bar( 0, 0, 1, 1);

plots a bar that covers 4 pixels: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) and (1,1).

The coordinate origin can be shifted using C<::translate> property,
that translates the (0,0) point to the given offset. Calls to
C<::translate>, C<::clipRect> and C<::region> always use the 'physical'
(0,0) point, whereas the plotting methods use the transformation result,
the 'logical' (0,0) point.

As noted before, these three properties can not be used in when an object 
is in its disabled state. 

=head1 API

=head2 Graphic context properties 

=over 4

=item backColor COLOR

Reflects background color in the graphic context. All drawing routines
that use non-solid or transparent fill or line patterns use this property value.

=item color COLOR

Reflects foreground color in the graphic context. All drawing routines
use this property value.

=item clipRect X1, Y1, X2, Y2

Selects the clipping rectangle corresponding to the physical canvas origin.
On get-call, returns the extent of the clipping area, if it is not rectangular,
or the clipping rectangle otherwise. The code

   $d-> clipRect( 1, 1, 2, 2);
   $d-> bar( 0, 0, 1, 1);

thus affects only one pixel at (1,1).

Set-call discards the previous C<::region> value.

Note: C<::clipRect> can not be used while the object is in the paint-disabled state,
its context is neither recorded nor used as a template 
( see L<"Graphic context and canvas">).

=item fillWinding BOOLEAN

Affect filling style of complex polygonal shapes filled by C<fillpoly>.
If 1, the filled shape contains no holes; otherwise, holes are present
where the shape edges cross.

Default value: 0

=item fillPattern ( [ @PATTERN ] ) or ( fp::XXX )

Selects 8x8 fill pattern that affects primitives that plot filled shapes:
bar(), fill_chord(), fill_ellipse(), fillpoly(), fill_sector(), floodfill().

Accepts either a C<fp::> constant or a reference to an array of 8 integers,
each representing 8 bits of each line in a pattern, where the first integer
is the topmost pattern line, and the bit 0x80 is the leftmost pixel in the line.

There are some predefined patterns, that can be referred via C<fp::> constants:

  fp::Empty
  fp::Solid
  fp::Line
  fp::LtSlash
  fp::Slash
  fp::BkSlash
  fp::LtBkSlash
  fp::Hatch
  fp::XHatch
  fp::Interleave
  fp::WideDot
  fp::CloseDot
  fp::SimpleDots
  fp::Borland
  fp::Parquet

( the actual patterns are hardcoded in primguts.c )
The default pattern is fp::Solid.

An example below shows encoding of fp::Parquet pattern:

   # 76543210  
     84218421  Hex

   0  $ $   $  51
   1   $   $   22
   2    $ $ $  15
   3 $   $     88
   4  $   $ $  45
   5   $   $   22
   6  $ $ $    54
   7 $   $     88

   $d-> fillPattern([ 0x51, 0x22, 0x15, 0x88, 0x45, 0x22, 0x54, 0x88 ]);

On a get-call always returns an array, never a C<fp::> constant.

=item font \%FONT

Manages font context. FONT hash acceptable values are
C<name>, C<height>, C<size>, C<width>, C<style> and C<pitch>. 

Synopsis:

   $d-> font-> size( 10);
   $d-> font-> name( 'Courier');
   $d-> font-> set(
     style => $x-> font-> style | fs::Bold,
     width => 22
   );

See L<"Fonts"> for the detailed descriptions.

Applies to text_out(), get_text_width(), get_text_box(), get_font_abc().

=item lineEnd VALUE

Selects a line ending cap for plotting primitives. VALUE 
can be one of

  le::Flat
  le::Square
  le::Round

constants. le::Round is the default value.

=item lineJoin VALUE

Selects a line joining style for polygons. VALUE 
can be one of

  lj::Round
  lj::Bevel
  lj::Miter

constants. lj::Round is the default value.

=item linePattern PATTERN

Selects a line pattern for plotting primitives. 
PATTERN is either a predefined C<lp::> constant, or 
a string where each even byte is a length of a dash,
and each odd byte is a length of a gap.

The predefined constants are:

    lp::Null           #    ""              /*              */
    lp::Solid          #    "\1"            /* ___________  */
    lp::Dash           #    "\x9\3"         /* __ __ __ __  */
    lp::LongDash       #    "\x16\6"        /* _____ _____  */
    lp::ShortDash      #    "\3\3"          /* _ _ _ _ _ _  */
    lp::Dot            #    "\1\3"          /* . . . . . .  */
    lp::DotDot         #    "\1\1"          /* ............ */
    lp::DashDot        #    "\x9\6\1\3"     /* _._._._._._  */
    lp::DashDotDot     #    "\x9\3\1\3\1\3" /* _.._.._.._.. */

Not all systems are capable of accepting user-defined line patterns,
and in such situation the C<lp::> constants are mapped to the system-defined
patterns. In Win9x, for example, lp::DashDotDot is much different from
its string definition therefore.

Default value is lp::Solid.

=item lineWidth WIDTH

Selects a line width for plotting primitives. 
If a VALUE is 0, then a 'cosmetic' pen is used - the thinnest
possible line that a device can plot. If a VALUE is greater than 0,
then a 'geometric' pen is used - the line width is set in device units.
There is a subtle difference between VALUE 0 and 1 in a way
the lines are joined.

Default value is 0.

=item palette [ @PALETTE ]

Selects solid colors in a system palette, as many as possible.
PALETTE is an array of integer triplets, where each is R, G and B
component. The call

   $d-> palette([128, 240, 240]);

selects a gray-cyan color, for example.

The return value from get-call is the content of the previous set-call,
not the actual colors that were copied to the system palette.

=item region OBJECT

Selects a clipping region applied to all drawing and painting routines.
The OBJECT is either undef, then the clip region is erased ( no clip ),
or a Prima::Image object with a bit depth of 1. The bit mask of OBJECT
is applied to the system clipping region. If the OBJECT is smaller than
the drawable, its exterior is assigned to clipped area as well.
Discards the previous C<::clipRect> value; successive get-calls 
to C<::clipRect> return the boundaries of the region.

Note: C<::region> can not be used while the object is in the paint-disabled state,
its context is neither recorded nor used as a template 
( see L<"Graphic context and canvas">).

=item resolution X, Y

A read-only property. Returns horizontal and vertical
device resolution in dpi.

=item rop OPERATION

Selects raster operation that applies to foreground color plotting routines.

See also: C<::rop2>, L<"Raster operations">.

=item rop2 OPERATION

Selects raster operation that applies to background color plotting routines.

See also: C<::rop>, L<"Raster operations">.

=item splinePrecision INT

Selects number of steps to use for each spline segment in C<spline>
and C<fill_spline> calls. In other words, determines smoothness of 
a curve. Minimum accepted value, 1, produces straight lines; maximum
value is not present, though it is hardly practical to set it higher
than the output device resolution.

Default value: 24

=item textOpaque FLAG

If FLAG is 1, then text_out() fills the text background area
with C<::backColor> property value before
drawing the text. Default value is 0, when text_out() plots
text only.

See get_text_box().

=item textOutBaseline FLAG

If FLAG is 1, then text_out() plots text on a given Y coordinate
correspondent to font baseline. If FLAG is 0, a Y coordinate is 
mapped to font descent line. Default is 0. 

=item translate X_OFFSET, Y_OFFSET

Translates the origin point by X_OFFSET and Y_OFFSET.
Does not affect C<::clipRect> and C<::region>. Not cumulative, 
so the call sequence

   $d-> translate( 5, 5);
   $d-> translate( 15, 15);

is equivalent to

   $d-> translate( 15, 15);

Note: C<::translate> can not be used while the object is in the paint-disabled state,
its context is neither recorded nor used as a template 
( see L<"Graphic context and canvas">).

=item begin_paint

Enters the enabled ( active paint ) state, returns success flag; if failed,
C<$@> contains the error.
Once the object is in enabled state, painting and drawing 
methods can perform write operations on a canvas.

See also: C<end_paint>, C<begin_paint_info>, L<"Graphic context and canvas">

=item begin_paint_info

Enters the information state, returns success flag; if failed,
C<$@> contains the error.
The object information state is same as enabled state ( see C<begin_paint>),
except painting and drawing methods do not change the object canvas.

See also: C<end_paint_info>, C<begin_paint>, L<"Graphic context and canvas">

=item end_paint

Exits the enabled state and returns the object to a disabled state. 

See also: C<begin_paint>, L<"Graphic context and canvas">

=item end_paint_info

Exits the information state and returns the object to a disabled state. 

See also: C<begin_paint_info>, L<"Graphic context and canvas">

=item font_match \%SOURCE, \%DEST, PICK = 1

Performs merging of two font hashes, SOURCE and DEST.
Returns the merge result. If PICK is true, matches the result
with a system font repository.

Called implicitly by C<::font> on set-call, allowing the following 
example to work:

   $d-> font-> set( size => 10);
   $d-> font-> set( style => fs::Bold);

In the example, the hash 'style => fs::Bold' does not overwrite
the previous font context ( 'size => 10' ) but gets added to it ( by font_match()),
providing the resulting font with both font properties set.

=item fonts <FAMILY = "", ENCODING = "">

Member of C<Prima::Application> and C<Prima::Printer>, does not
present in C<Prima::Drawable>.

Returns an array of font metric hashes for a given font FAMILY
and ENCODING.  Every hash has full set of elements described in L<"Fonts">.

If called without parameters, returns an array of same hashes
where each hash represents a member of font family from every
system font set. It this special case, each font hash contains
additional C<encodings> entry, which points to an array of encodings
available for the font.

If called with FAMILY parameter set but no ENCODING is set, enumerates
all combinations of fonts with all available encodings.

If called with FAMILY set to an empty string, but ENCODING specified,
returns only fonts that can be displayed with the encoding.

Example:

  print sort map {"$_->{name}\n"} @{$::application-> fonts};

=item get_bpp

Returns device color depth. 1 is for black-and-white monochrome,
24 for true color, etc.

=item get_font_abc FIRST_CHAR = -1, LAST_CHAR = -1, UNICODE = 0

Returns ABC font metrics for the given range, starting at
FIRST_CHAR and ending with LAST_CHAR. If parameters are -1,
the default range ( 0 and 255 ) is assumed. UNICODE boolean flag
is responsible of representation of characters in 127-255 range.
If 0, the default, encoding-dependent characters are assumed.
If 1, the U007F-U00FF glyphs from Latin-1 set are used.

The result is an integer array reference, where every character
glyph is referred by three integers, each triplet containing
A, B and C values.

For detailed explanation of ABC meaning, see L<"Font ABC metrics">;

Context used: font

=item get_nearest_color COLOR

Returns a nearest possible solid color in representation
of object-bound graphic device. Always returns same color
if the device bit depth is equal or greater than 24.

=item get_paint_state

Returns paint state value on of ps:: constants - C<ps::Disabled> if the object is in the disabled state,
C<ps::Enabled> for the enabled state, C<ps::Information> for the information state.

For brevity, mb::Disabled is equal to 0 so this allows for simple boolean testing whether one can 
get/set graphical properties on an object.

See L<"Graphic context and canvas"> for more.

=item get_physical_palette

Returns an anonymous array of integers, in (R,G,B) format,
every color entry described by three values, in range 0 - 255.

The physical palette array is non-empty only on paletted graphic devices,
the true color devices return an empty array.

The physical palette reflects the solid colors currently available
to all programs in the system. The information is volatile if 
the system palette can change colors, since any other application
may change the system colors at any moment.

=item get_text_width TEXT, ADD_OVERHANG = 0

Returns TEXT string width if it would be drawn using currently
selected font.

If ADD_OVERHANG is 1, the first character's absolute A value and the last
character's absolute C value are added to the string if they are negative.

See more on ABC values at L<"Font ABC metrics">.

Context used: font

=item get_text_box TEXT

Returns TEXT string extensions if it would be drawn using currently
selected font.

The result is an anonymous array of 5 points ( 5 integer pairs  
in (X,Y) format). These 5 points are offsets for the following string
extents, given the string is plotted at (0,0):

1: start of string at ascent line ( top left )

2: start of string at descent line ( bottom left )

3: end of string at ascent line ( top right )

4: end of string at descent line ( bottom right )

5: concatenation point

The concatenation point coordinates (XC,YC) are coordinated passed to
consequent text_out() call so the conjoint string would plot as if it was a
part of TEXT. Depending on the value of the C<textOutBaseline> property, the
concatenation point is located either on the baseline or on the descent line.

=item render_spline VERTICES, [ PRECISION ]

Renders cubic spline from set of VERTICES to a polyline with given precision.
The method can be called as static, i.e.  with no object initialized. PRECISION
integer, if not given, is read from C<splinePrecision> property if the method
was called on an alive object; in case of static call, default value 24 is
used.

The method is internally used by C<spline> and C<fill_spline>, and is provided
for cases when these are insufficient.

=item text_wrap TEXT, WIDTH, OPTIONS, TAB_INDENT = 8

Breaks TEXT string in chunks that would fit
into WIDTH pixels wide box. 

The break algorithm and its result are governed by OPTIONS integer value
which is a combination of C<tw::> constants:

=over 4

=item tw::CalcMnemonic

Use 'hot key' semantics, when a character preceded by ~ has
special meaning - it gets underlined. If this bit is set, the first tilde character used
as an escapement is not calculated, and never appeared in the result 
apart from the escaped character.

=item tw::CollapseTilde

In addition to tw::CalcMnemonic, removes '~' character from
the resulting chunks.

=item tw::CalcTabs

If set, calculates a tab ('\t') character as TAB_INDENT times space characters.

=item tw::ExpandTabs

If set, expands tab ('\t') character as TAB_INDENT times space characters.

=item tw::BreakSingle

Defines procedure behavior when the text cannot be fit in WIDTH,
does not affect anything otherwise.

If set, returns an empty array.
If unset, returns a text broken by minimum number of characters per chunk.
In the latter case, the width of the resulting text blocks B<will> exceed WIDTH.

=item tw::NewLineBreak

Forces new chunk after a newline character ('\n') is met.
If UTF8 text is passed, unicode line break characters C<0x2028> and C<0x2029> 
produce same effect as the newline character.

=item tw::SpaceBreak

Forces new chunk after a space character (' ') or a tab character ('\t') are met.

=item tw::ReturnChunks

Defines the result of text_wrap() function.

If set, the array consists of integer pairs,
each consists of a text offset within TEXT and a its length.

If unset, the resulting array consists from text chunks.

=item tw::ReturnLines

Equals to 0, is a mnemonic to an unset tw::ReturnChunks.

=item tw::WordBreak

If unset, the TEXT breaks as soon as the chunk width exceeds WIDTH.
If set, tries to keep words in TEXT so they do not appear in two
chunks, e.g. breaks TEXT by words, not by characters.

=item tw::ReturnFirstLineLength

If set, C<text_wrap> proceeds until the first line is wrapped, either by
width or ( if specified ) by break characters. Returns length of the
resulting line. Used for efficiency when the reverse function to C<get_text_width>
is needed.

=back

If OPTIONS has tw::CalcMnemonic or tw::CollapseTilde bits set,
then the last scalar in the array result is a special hash reference.
The hash contains extra information regarding the 'hot key' 
underline position - it is assumed that '~' - escapement denotes
an underlined character. The hash contains the following keys:

=over 4

=item tildeLine

Chunk index that contains the escaped character.
Set to undef if no ~ - escapement was found. 
The other hash information is not relevant in this case.

=item tildeStart

Horizontal offset of a beginning of the line that underlines 
the escaped character.

=item tildeEnd

Horizontal offset of an end of the line that underlines 
the escaped character.

=item tildeChar

The escaped character.
