CHANGELOG - Disc-Cover


Version 1.5.6

- fixed: version incorrectly displayed

- fixed: proper encoding of languages through inputenc package
  (thanks to Matthias Drochner)


Version 1.5.5

- fixed: better handling of double disc titles
  (patch by Lars at systemausfall.org)

- fixed: isolatin1 is removed from the userpackages as it has become depreciated.
  (thanks to Markus Gapp)

- fixed: AllMusic works again (new layout of website)

- added: new template paper-box, which creates a sleeve that holds your cd.
  (contributed by Lothar Schweikle-Droll)

- added: new template that places only a a picture on the front cover, which is
  scaled to fit the whole cover.

- added: added option template_list, which generates list of feasible templates. 
  (patch by Jereme Corrado, the new Debian maintainer)

- changed: new template_list option used in the webserver index.cgi
  (patch by Jereme Corrado, the new Debian maintainer)

- changed: better regular expression for getting covers from AllMusic.com
  (patch by Julius Gehr).


Version 1.5.4

- fixed: fatal bug causing disc-cover not to work under Linux without -f flag
  (thanks to Thibaut Cousin for the quick response).


Version 1.5.3

- changed: online.cgi works on SunOS

- changed: Audio:CD library is no longer required when using the -f option.
  This makes setting up a webserver much easier.

- added: new template that only prints backs of jewel cases, called backonly
  (Sebastian Kaps)

- bugfix: latex templates set by user were overwritten (Christophe Labouisse)o

- added: to the FAQ, how to include pictures without quality reduction.

- bugfix: forgot \ in linewidth command for Disc 1&2 lines (Harry James Butler)

- bugfix: fixed problem with = symbol in ttitle entries (Yaniv Aran).


Version 1.5.2

- added: new option -u (or -uppercase) that fixes cddb entries written in all lowercase,
  which too many people still do!

- bugfix: problem with title lines (Disc 1 & Disc 2) of double discs.


Version 1.5.1

- changed: picture command \DCpicture now only provides the basic command for including a picture
  in LaTeX. This makes it possible to do almost anything with the picture now.

- changed: the templates have been changed to use the new \DCpicture command, the picture will
  be centered and the border has been removed. 


Version 1.5.0

- bugfix: problems with title of double cd when both titles in cddb files were
  equal (thanks to Jacco de Kraker).

- bugfix: misaligned lines when 'foreign' characters in capital appeared,
  like umlauts and such (thanks to Martin Hensel and Sebastian Djupsjöbacka).

- changed: internal code for cover types has been replaced by external template
  files. This should make it easier for people to change templates and add new
  ones. Because of this move some configuration variables have become obsolete:
  $config_frontcover_height, $config_frontcover_width,
  $config_backcover_height, $config_backcover_width,
  $config_tevion_cover_height, $config_tevion_cover_width,
  $config_tevion_flap_height, $config_tevion_flap_width1,
  $config_tevion_flap_width2

- changed: moved disc-cover information bar to the bottom (should prevent
  printer problems).

- changed: the LaTeX output (not the final result) to get rid of many (all?)
  LaTeX warnings (thanks to Martin Haefele).

- changed: the LaTeX files made by Disc-Cover contain newcommands statements
  that can be used in templates to layout a cover. These commands all start
  with '\DC'. For example: \DCtracks gives the list of tracks already formatted,
  while \DCtitle just gives the title of the disc.

- added: information about the system when using -V, for better bugreports.

- added: new template for audio cassette tapes (use '-c tape')

- added: \DCgenre can be used to include the genre in a template. Also its
  colour may be changed through the config file.

- added: new script online.cgi and three pictures to determine whether a server is
  available or very busy.



Version 1.4.0

- bugfix: fixed nonsense output and errors when first track title is empty
  (thanks to Raphael Goubet).

- bugfix: no more warnings when $HOME is not defined (for webservers).

- bugfix: some verbose message lacked Disc-Cover: prefix.

- bugfix: when a picture is put on the front (or -allmusic is used), the extended
  disc info is trimmed down to make sure it fits below the picture.

- changed: safer execution of external programs such as wget, mv and cp.
  Especially important for webservers.

- changed: removed documentation in docs directory, it has become outdated.
  If anyone is interested in translating documentation, the full documentation
  now resides under 'disc-cover -H'.

- added: new option '-allmusic', which searches on www.allmusic.com for a
  cover picture to put on the front cover.

- added: new case type called 'sleeve', which just prints a front cover, but puts
  the tracklistings on it. (thanks for the suggestions Adam Perer et al.)

- added: new case type called 'x-slim', which exchanges the flap and side.

- added: three more entries to the FAQ about installation SuSE and Mike's grip program
  (many thanks to Thomas Kakolewski).


Version 1.3.2

- changed: added message about Acrobat Reader when using '-t pdf'

- fixed: (Glenn Huxtable) the size of the front cover in slim case mode was
  wrong.

- added: new case for slim Tevion cases, thanks to Tilman Vogel for the patch.
  Use -c tevion-slim to produce it.

- added: the ability to understand various artist cds, where every track is
  formatted using the 'artist / title' method. (suggested bu Ivan Fernandez)

- added: algorithm that attempts to create a nice title for double cds (they
  often have things like 'disc 1' or '1/2' inserted)

- added: new slim case type for people that still use letter instead of the
  standard A4, it is called letter-slim. It removes the flaptext to make room.


Version 1.3.1

- fixed: problem with slim case where LaTeX (and thus Disc-Cover) would fail
  in producing a cover if no front picture was included by the user.

- fixed: if the flaptext was empty, the box containing it (most top one)
  woulde be in the wrong size.

- added: index.cgi script in freedb directory, which powers the on-line
  version of Disc-Cover.


Version 1.3.0

- changed: much better layout of the tracks, especially tracknames that use
  multiple lines. Also, better aligned tracktime and tracktitle

- added: configuration options to change height and width of both front and
  back cover, thereby getting rid of e-mails stating: I believe the xxx-cover
  should be h X w cm ;-)

- changed: layout of covers and header text on the page is a bit different,
  everything is more compact and better centered on the page.

- fixed: for some long cd titles the text of the title would be justified.

- added: new command parameter '-c' to choose the type of case you want
  Disc-Cover to generate. The default is jewel, but also slimcase can be
  chosen to create a cover (in one piece) suitable for those slim case
  variants that save precious shelf space.


Version 1.2.2

- fixed: with '-t cddb' extended track information was not inserted (thanks to
  Rodney Kanno for finding this one)

- fixed: problems with multiple \n in -a option.

- added: possibility for user to add latex style files, such as isolatin2 in
  the configuration file.

- changed: increased width of sideflaps (artist/title) of backflap and
  improved centering of text on it.

- added: option -S to create a default configuration for CDDB server (FreeDB
  is used of course)

- changed: old option -n is back by popular demand, which makes creating new
  covers possible again.

- fixed: problem of not being able to do standard input and output with cddb
  at the same time is solved. Better way of handling cddb type (does not read
  cache directory anymore).
  
- fixed: t after an empty line in -a would result in a loss of the t.


Version 1.2.1

- fixed: problem with ` quote in artis/title.

- fixed: problem with quote in title/artist when creating file.

- fixed: removed space between front and back to fix problems with letter
  paper format (thanks goes to Hans Ecke).

- fixed: small bug in -H option, now uses pod2man instead of perldoc which I
  think is more common.

- fixed: problems with \n and \t in extended disc info. Would have different
  results when reading a disc and using cddb files.

- changed: most of the english documentation files have been moved into the
  manual page, these include FAQ, README and TODO. Use '-H' to see the manual.
  
- changed: front is moved more into center of paper to have better
  'sideflaps'. Read the FAQ about this.

- changed: -V (verbose) flag gives much more information which can be helpful
  when you submit problems/bugs to the author.

- changed: updated documentation (manual page), created internal links.

- changed: system calls mkdir and rmdir replaced with perl's internal ones.


Version 1.2.0

- added: support for double cds with the -2 option.

- changed: size of covers (thanks to Roman Silar).

- changed: removed disc-cover.1, replaced with -H option.  Do a 'pod2man
  disc-cover > disc-cover.1' to get the old manual file back.

- fixed: -e flag was not used in html and txt output.


Version 1.1.1

- added: genre on last line of bottom text front cover with -g flag.

- added: option '-C' to generate a configuration file based on current
  settings and commandline options.

- fixed: 'defined(@array) is deprecated' bug.

- fixed: problem with multiple (\n) lines in bottom text front cover.

- fixed: problem with unvalid cdrom devices (thanks to Roman Shterenzon).

- changed: everywhere, times are now in ISO 8601 format min:sec (thanks to
  Eduardo Pérez Ureta).

- changed: out of date documentation updated, regarding features and required
  software.

- removed: obsolete flags, options and documentation because of move to the
  AudioCD library.


Version 1.1.0

- added: an additional flap on one side of the back cover. This will be
  visible when used with fully transparent jewel cases. By default the user's
  name taken from the comment field is inserted. Can be overridden with the
  config_flaptext variable in the configuration file or with the -b option.

- added: cddb entry is displayed in comments on output page.

- added: HTML output with the '-t html' option.

- added: parameter -V that enables verbose output for debugging.

- fixed: bug that caused disc-cover to choke on title/artist names with only
  one double quote (") inside.

- fixed: extended disc info is trimmed to stop it from destroying the layout.

- changed: parameter -r is now -R.

- changed: disc-cover is now using the Audio::CD library. This should be more
  compatible, especially for FreeBSD users. Audio::CD uses the libcdaudio
  libraries.

- changed: drastic change of the layout engine of cd contents. By scaling the
  postscript output it will always fit! But on the dark side, this could mean
  infinitely small fonts...

- changed: lots of code cleanups (removed almost 300 lines) that make it
  easier to maintain (read: reducing chance or more bugs :)

- changed: replaced command line parser with Getopt::Long library.


Version 1.0.1

- fixed: bug that caused '-pic' not be recognised as a valid command line
  option.

- fixed: problem of pictures included with '-eps' (should have been '-pic')
  not being removed from the temporary directory, thereby causing an error
  when the temporary directory itself was removed.


Version 1.0.0

- added: configuration files for the user ($HOME/.disc-coverrc) and system
  (/etc/disc-cover.conf) mainly to set variables such as proxies, cddb
  servers, temp dir and output format. It uses Perl syntax. Sample included in
  "example.conf".

- added: colour support. Colour title, artist, items, time, track numbers and
  extended information in your own preferred colour.

- added: support for handling more than one cddb server. The default is still
  FreeDB, but more sites can be added in your own config file.

- fixed: front cover graphics is now fully supported for PDF files.

- fixed: security bug. The temporary files were a security risk. The new way
  of handling temporary files (placing them in a newly created directory)
  removes this risk.

- fixed: rectangular brackets are correctly handled.

- fixed: problems with \t in entries. For now every \t is converted into a
  space. Should be fixed to use actual tabs in LaTeX.

- fixed: problem with '-eps' (now '-pic') when the path to the file was
  relative.

- fixed: FreeDB bug that gave the wrong error when no cdrom was found.

- fixed: problem with cdlabelgen when there is no artist.

- changed: font of numbering of tracks has been changed to Sans Serif.

- changed: removed dependence on LaTeX package 'rotating'.

- changed: added dependence on LaTeX package 'ifthen'.

- changed: copyright year.

- changed: the option '-eps' has been changed to '-pic' because of the support
  of pictures in PDF files. 

- changed: lots of improvements in the manual page.


Version 0.9.6

- added: new option '-n' to generate a new cddb file to be edited by hand (or
  script). Very handy for homebrewn cds.

- added: new option '-eps <filename>' to put a picture in EPS (Encapsulated
  PostScript) or PS (PostScript) on the front cover without scaling of
  converting.

- added: preliminary support for characters not in the isolatin1 standard,
  still some missing characters.

- fixed: bug that caused wrong layout (duplicate tracks) in the track listing.

- fixed: removed multiple lines in extended track info.

- fixed: problems with slashes in disc titles and artists are hopefully sorted
  out.

- fixed: numerous small bugs in FreeDB.pm

- fixed: problem in FreeDB.pm that made it output 'Warning can't find
  AutoLoader'.

- changed: FreeDB shows error when ioctl does not work, such as reported on
  NetBSD.

- changed: instead of the old Latex package epsfig we now use graphicx to do
  the picture on the front cover.

- changed: because of license problems and frequent downtime of the cddb
  server disc-cover now uses the freedb server.

- removed: quiet option '-q' because it has become obsolete. All screen output
  goes to stderr from now on.


Version 0.9.5

- added: new option '-p <filename>' to add a picture to the front cover. This
  requires the LaTeX package epsfig and the program convert that comes with
  ImageMagick.

- changed: uses freedb.freedb.org instead of www.cddb.com

- changed: better error handling of command line.

- changed: better overall error handling and solution providing.

- changed: better handling of wrong input (changes to FreeDB).


Version 0.9.4

- fixed: problems that are occurring due to a change in the cddb servers.

- fixed: some people have entries stored in the root of the cddb cache dir
  these will be used now as well.

- fixed: problem where disc-cover would give the error 'Can't locate
  auto/FreeDB/end_program.al'.

- added: distribution files for FreeDB to make a clean perl module.


Version 0.9.3

- added: new option '-e' which results in extended track info to be added to
  the back cover whenever available.

- added: Spanish documentation is back in docs/spanish

- added: German documentation now in docs/german

- changed: all of the cddb code has been transferred to a separate module
  called FreeDB, on which Disc-Cover is now dependent.

- fixed: problem with empty track names producing invalid LaTeX code.

- fixed: problem with two backslashes immediately following each other in a
  track name.

- fixed: problems with external programs such as Latex, dvips, pdflatex and mv
  are now caught and a message will be displayed.


Version 0.9.2

- fixed: problems with artist and cd titles over multiple lines in a cddb
  entry (is not in cddb protocol).

- fixed: problems with track titles and extended track info over multiple
  lines in a cddb entry (track titles over multiple lines is not in cddb
  protocol).

- fixed: problems with some cddb entry not having 'seconds' behind disc length
  (is not in cddb protocol).

- changed: when the artist and cd title are too long to be put on the sides
  the font size is made smaller until it fits or until the font is tiny.

- changed: latex parameters to change the page width, height and offsets are
  now in a perl variable at the start of disc-cover's code. Makes it more easy
  when people need small adjustments for there printer.

- changed: the error message when the device can not be opened. Put in an
  extra line telling people to log out and in before trying again.

- added: another LaTeX package called 'times' for those who had the default to
  something else and ended up with a horrible result. Enable this at the start
  of disc-cover's code.

- added: documentation using pod. Also a man page build from this is included
  now.


Version 0.9.1

- fixed: problem in entries having extended disc info with a \n at the end of
  a line, this resulted in a 'Could not find file error'.


Version 0.9.0

- added: the front cover now gets the extended disc info printed on at the
  bottom. The contents can be overridden with the '-a <text>' command.

- changed: font of the bottom text to sans-serif.

- changed: documentation is updated and should be more useful. Removed
  documentation in Spanish because it is outdated and I do not speak or write
  Spanish.

- fixed: better error handling if the cdrom device cannot be opened for
  reading (for instance if the user has no access rights).

- fixed: better error handling when user selects wrong format.

- removed: removed loose output format as it only makes maintenance more
  tedious. To compensate a tip is added to the FAQ for those who want to
  minimise the number of cuts.


Version 0.8.5

- fixed: problems with some Latex distributions causing Disc-Cover not to
  produce dvi files.

- fixed: some reported errors of tracks that were not appearing in the texfile
  with some cddb entries.

- added: FAQ in docs/* directories. This file will answer questions I get in
  my mailbox too often.

- fixed: problem when the cddb cache directory was a link.

- fixed: quick hack to ensure the cache only finds one file, namely the first
  one it encounters. This should become an interactive process.


Version 0.8.4

- added: option '-F' to force a cddb lookup.

- added: standard logo for the cdlabelgen output ('-t lbl'), it's a penguin!

- fixed: problems with interactive handling of inexact matches.

- fixed: better check of categories in the cddb cache directory (~/.cddb),
  will add new genres from server to the list.

- fixed: better handling of quiet option '-q`.


Version 0.8.3

- added: proxy support. To activate supply a proxy server in the beginning
  for the $proxy_value variable.

- fixed: removed ^M after track titles which caused some Latex distributions
  to fail.


Version 0.8.2

- added: new format in plain ASCII, use '-t txt'

- added: new format for use in cdlabelgen, use '-f lbl'

- added: new format in Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF), use '-f pdf'

- added: ability to handle cds that have inexact matches. User will be
  prompted to choose which match should be used. Up to 10 matches.

- fixed: bug of ^M in artist and title.

- fixed: all '{\em ...}' in LaTeX changed to '\emph{...}'

- fixed: error in substituting ':' for every '\' in a filename.

- fixed: buf in calculating discid, could result in string of less than 8
  characters.

- changed: every pack('CCCP'...) in pack('C8'...), works better?


Version 0.8.1

- fixed: a slash in a filename is translated to a colon.

- added: caches files in a directory (default: $HOME/.cddb) for off line
   usage. This directory can be shared with cdcd.


Version 0.8

- added: The files docs/spanish/* contain the appropriate documentation in
    Spanish for version 0.7.

- added: The files docs/dutch/* contain the appropriate documentation in
    Dutch.

- removed: dependencies on cdcd and cda.

- removed: parameters '-cda' and '-cdcd'.

- added: build-in support for querying a cddb database. This is very
    experimental!

- changed: layout of the track numbers. Numbers below 10 are now
    right-aligned with numbers above and equal to 10.

- fixes: some minor adjustments in the layout of the tracks on the back
    cover.


Version 0.7

- added: the total time of a disc is added as the last line of the track
    list

- added: possibility of using cddb formatted files as input. This way files
    produced by grip and cdda2wav can directly be used to generate layouts.
    The option '-f <filename>' is used to select a file.

- changed: the option '-f' is no longer used for choosing the layout format.
    Use '-loose' or '-connected'.

- changed: the '-c' option is no longer used to select the program to
    connect to the database, from now on use '-cda' or '-cdcd'.

- fixed: the artist and title of the cd at the sides of the jewel case have
    been exchanged. This much more reflects the way original disks are
    labelled: artist followed by title

- fixed: a reported problem of filenames not properly being used. Sometimes
    an 'enter' character would stick to the end of a title causing this
    filename to appear "artist_-_title\n.ps".

- fixed: filenames starting with a '-' would not work.

- added: using '-o -' sends result to standard output.


Version 0.6.1

- fixed: problems with artist/title containing Latex characters. Disc-Cover
    did not save the file to disc.

- fixed: problem with the new connected format, the front cover was too
    small.

- fixed: problem with the new connected format, the whole layout would not
    align on paper in letter format.


Version 0.6

- added: a new layout of the covers on the page to make cutting an easier
    job. The option '-f' can be used to choose between 'loose' (default) or
    'connected'. The format connected aligns both covers and connects them.
    This way the covers can be cut in 5 cuts opposed to 8 cuts in the loose
    format.


Version 0.5.2

- fixed: bug that caused the artist name to be mangled under cdcd.


Version 0.5.1

- changed: a nicer dotted line between the name and the length of a track.

- fixed: problems with files when a title or artist had an apostrophe in
    their name.

- fixed: problems when a cd had the artist or title missing.


Version 0.5

- added: support for cda (comes with xmcd). Cdcd is the default way of
    communicating with cddb, if this fails cda is used. The parameter -c can
    be used to force the use of either cdcd or cda.

- fixed: problems with LaTeX in the MLTex distribution are fixed. For some
    reason it does not understand the --interaction= option.


Version 0.4.1

- fixed: problems when LaTeX was run, it paused and cause the program to
    stop.  

- fixed: the program could not detect if there was no disc in the drive.


Version 0.4

- changed: the program no longer outputs to 'disc-cover.ps' as default, but
    to a file named after the artist and album name: 'artist_-_album.ps'. All
    spaces are replaced by underscores.

- added: new command line parameter '-q' for quiet mode, no information or
    warnings will be displayed (only errors).


Version 0.3

- changed: added some information on the output regarding the program. This
    lowers the covers, thereby fixing the problem some printers had with not
    printing the top cover correctly.

- added: detects and exits if there is no disc loaded in the cdrom drive.

- fixed: added support for special characters from the isolatin1 standard,
    by using the isolatin1 package for Latex.

- added: support for cds up to 99 tracks (maximum number).


Version 0.2

- fixed: bug when using -l or -d without -o, would result in a wrong
    filename.  

- removed: latex package dependency 'color', 'epsfig' and 'url'.

- added: support for 22-27 tracks in smaller font.

- added: support for 28-54 tracks in smaller font and two columns.


Version 0.1

- initial release.
