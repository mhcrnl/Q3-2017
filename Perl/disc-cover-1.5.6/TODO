TODO - Disc-Cover

- Universal way of defining covers (templates), so that it becomes easier to handle the
  enormous amount of different types of covers used over the world. (start has been made)

- Matthew Hand <Matthew.Hand@defence.gov.au>: handle html tags within cddb entries (such as &amp;)
  (Volker Moell suggests to use HTML::Entities module:  $parsed_line = HTML::Entities::decode($unparsed_line);)

- add use cddb discid to search

- better cddb server configuration (now handled by Audio::CD library)

- find more on DYEAR= entry, do people really use this? (suggested by Attila Bogar)

- cdindex

- covers for the cd itself (like cd-circleprint does)

- more case support?

- caching of allmusic covers?

- adding additional lines to aid in cutting covers.

- take extd info from double cds as title instead of 'Disc 1' and 'Disc 2' headings.

- go through all those e-mails with suggestions, bugs and patches. Keep them coming! ;-)
