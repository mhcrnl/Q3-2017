version 4.3 (3 April 2005):

- Bugfix: semicolon and double-quote embedded in text string was not properly
  handled.  Re-implemented lexer to have a robust handling.

- Re-added support for GIF files (if the GD perl module supports it).

version 4.2 (1 May 2003):

- Bugfix: origin was not initialized to (0,0), so that MOVETO was required
  to set it.  This has been fixed.

version 4.1 (27 January 2002):

- Addition of JPEG input/output (if the installed GD library supports it).

- Bugfixes for the use of the pre-processor.

version 4.0 (9 November 1999):

- Renamed the program from 'gifc' to 'imc'.  Although the syntax for the
  input files has not changed, the major version is stepped up.  This is
  because imc does not generate GIF files anymore, but PNG files, due to
  patent restrictions.

- imc now requires GD 1.22 instead of 1.18.

version 3.1 (18 September 1999):

- Only one fix really: arcs that stretched for about 180 degrees were
  not correctly filled.  This is fixed now.

- A small problem in configure was fixed.

version 3.0 (23 April 1999):

- Quite some bugfixes.  Biggest bugfix: horizontal and vertical text
  and image alignment parameters were interchanged with respect to their
  logical meaning.  Fixed the bug, but some scripts may depend on this,
  so I'll make it a major version change now...

- Implemented INTERLACED command: gives a fading-in effect in
  some browsers.

- The CLOSED subcommand for the ARC command is extended: it can
  now be CLOSED PIE or CLOSED SEGMENT.  The old syntax CLOSED is
  a synonym of CLOSED PIE (this makes it backwards compatible).

- Converted configure/make steps to autoconf/automake: brings
  greater portability !  I ditched --with-pp in the process,
  because it doesn't seem to be useful: the pre-processor is always in
  some standard location, no?  Let me know if I'm wrong...  Note also
  that 'make test' changed to 'make check' due to these changes.

- Implemented general rotation and mirroring of text and images.  New
  commands: TEXTMIRROR, IMAGEROTATE, IMAGEMIRROR, the ROTATE and MIRROR
  subcommands for IMAGE, and the MIRROR subcommand for TEXT and TEXTAT.
  The restrictions from 2.6 on the rotation of text have been lifted.
  Please test this thoroughly...

version 2.6 (13 March 1999):

- Some changes to the configure script: --with-perl instead of --perl,
  --with-pp instead of --pp (more compliant with standard configure)

- Added 'make test' to makefile.

- Implemented rotating of text, but only counterclockwise rotation
  of 90 degrees is supported for now.  The syntax leaves room for
  extension however.  New commands are: TEXTROTATE and the ROTATE
  subcommand for TEXT and TEXTAT.

version 2.5 (30 August 1998):

- More portable makefile, more GNU-style configure script.

- CLOSED subcommand for the ARC command (interesting for pie charts).
  A closed arc can also be filled.

- First public release.

version 2.4 (13 July 1998):

- Miscellaneous bugfixes.

- More extensive configure script and makefile.

- make install

- Support of C style comments, also without pre-processor.

- manual page and HTML formatted reference guide.

version 2.3 (5 July 1998):

- Miscellaneous bugfixes.

- Coordinates can also be negative, but points with negative coordinates
  are never drawn.

- SIZE subcommand in IMAGE command can also use floating point percentages
  instead of integer absolute sizes.

- Basic configure script and makefile.

version 2.2 (30 June 1998):

- Miscellaneous bugfixes.

- Added the IMAGEALIGN command and the ALIGN subcommand for the IMAGE
  command.

- The angles in the ARC command do not have to lie between -360 and
  360 degrees anymore (anything that fits into a signed integer on
  your machine should be ok).

version 2.1 (28 June 1998):

- Miscellaneous bugfixes.

- Changed the name of the program from gifc.pl to gifc.

- Added the -I command line option and the "include" CGI parameter for
  specifying standard include directories.  Added the -h and -v command
  line options.

- Added the TEXTALIGN command and the ALIGN subcommand for the TEXT and
  TEXTAT commands.

- The angles in the ARC command can now also be negative, but they must
  lie between -360 and 360 degrees.

- Added the ANGLES command.  This enables to specify whether angles should
  increase clockwise or anticlockwise.  The default is still clockwise.

- Added the FILL command.

version 2.0 (21 June 1998):

- Miscellaneous bugfixes.

- The default origin is now at the top left of the image.  The setting can
  be changed with the ORIGIN command. (-> backward incompatibility)

- When in the IMAGE command the filename is omitted, the previous filename
  is now used.  A size can be specified to scale the image.  The image
  can also be an X Bitmap file.

- Addition of TEXTAT, LINE and RECTANGLE commands.  Changed CIRCLE command:
  the X and Y coordinate of the center must be given. (-> backward
  incompatibility)  Addition of ELLIPSE and ARC commands.

- A semicolon can be used as separator between two commands on one line.
  However, this means that the semicolon cannot be used anymore to start a
  comment. (-> backward incompatibility)

- Possibility to use arithmetic expressions (within braces).

- Script is first fed through the C pre-processor if one can be found.

- Addition of transparent color.

- Step-up of major version number because of backward incompatibilities.

version 1.1 (17 June 1998):

- Script can be used in a URL as CGI script: the GIF image is then output
  to the browser.

- X11 color names can be used to denote colors.

- Text can now be in a given color and with a given size: TEXTCOLOUR and
  TEXTSIZE commands; COLOUR and SIZE subcommands for TEXT command.

version 1.0 (16 June 1998):

- Basic syntax.

- Following commands are supported: BACKGROUND, LINECOLOUR, FILLCOLOUR,
  LINEWIDTH, MOVETO, LINETO, TEXT, CIRCLE, IMAGE, SIZE.
