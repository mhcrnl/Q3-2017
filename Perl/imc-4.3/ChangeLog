1999-11-09  Peter Verthez  <Peter.Verthez@advalvas.be>

	* release of version 4.0.

1999-11-08  Peter Verthez  <Peter.Verthez@advalvas.be>

	* doc/: updated documentation.

	* imc.1: updated man page.

	* examples/gifcmp.pl: renamed to imcmp.pl; changed to support PNG
	instead of GIF files.

	* configure.in: Changes to support PNG instead of GIF files.

	* imc.dist: Changes in image loading and writing functions to support
	PNG instead of GIF files.  From now on, GIF files are not supported
	anymore.  XPM files can now be loaded with the IMAGE command (next to
	PNG and XBM files).

	* imc.dist (do_image): Factored out the actual loading of the image
	(new functions do_input_image and supported_input_types).

	* imc.dist (init_program): Added detection of type of desired output
	image.  New functions get_image_type and supported_output_types.

	* imc.dist (output_gif): Renamed to output_image.  Factored out the
	actual writing of the image to the function do_output_image.

	* all: Changed name of the program from 'gifc' to 'imc'.  This will
	be version 4.0 (I'm not going back to 1.0, because it is essentially
	the same program).

1999-09-11  Peter Verthez  <Peter.Verthez@advalvas.be>

	* release of version 3.1.

	* gifc.dist (do_arc): Bugfix for filling of 180 degree (or close) arc.

1999-05-23  Peter Verthez  <Peter.Verthez@advalvas.be>

	* configure.in: corrected test for version of GD perl module (previous
	test didn't check anything in fact...).

1999-04-23  Peter Verthez  <Peter.Verthez@advalvas.be>

	* release of version 3.0.

1999-04-21  Peter Verthez  <Peter.Verthez@advalvas.be>

	* examples/: Final gifc test scripts.

1999-04-19  Peter Verthez  <Peter.Verthez@advalvas.be>

	* gifc.dist (rotate_and_mirror_image): Bugfix: don't multiply again
	with $angledirection: this must be done at the time of specification,
	not execution.

	* examples/ref/: New directory; moved all reference GIF files from
	examples directory to here; created examples/ref/Makefile.am; changes
	in configure.in, examples/Makefile.am and README.

	* examples/: Still more gifc test scripts.

	* gifc.dist (do_import_image): Bugfix: point with highest coordinate
	was calculated in a wrong way.

1999-04-18  Peter Verthez  <Peter.Verthez@advalvas.be>

	* gifc.dist (do_text, do_image): Factored out common part to
	new function do_import_image.

	* gifc.dist (do_text, do_image): Found MAJOR bug in text and image
	alignment: horizontal and vertical alignment were interchanged (with
	respect to their logical meaning).  And that already since the
	beginning !!! Fixed the bug, but I'd better make it a major version
	change now (3.0)...

	* gifc.dist (do_arc): Bugfix: Corrected condition for drawing
	closing lines + round off the coordinates for the arc end points
	correctly.

	* gifc.dist (split_arc): Bugfix: both start and end angle small
	negative was not handled properly (and other fixes).

	* gifc.dist (do_arc): Bugfix: give $closedarc initial value 0.

	* examples/gifcmp.pl: Bugfix for transparent colors.

	* examples/: Bugfixes in Makefile.am for VPATH build.

	* doc/: Added note in gifc.txt and gifc.html that xv does not take
	transparency into account and may show the GIF wrongly.

	* gifc.dist (get_color): Bugfix: if TRANSPARENT asked: return
	transparent color if available.

	* gifc.dist (process_input): Bugfix: remove comments *before*
	splitting the line in commands.

	* gifc.dist (do_image): Bugfix in the check whether the filename
	is a subcommand: possibly no filename given.

	* gifc.dist (do_text): Corrected bug in alignment of text when
	rotated of 90 degrees (residue from release 2.6 in correction for
	origin at bottom).

	* examples/: Various new gifc test scripts.

1999-04-17  Peter Verthez  <Peter.Verthez@advalvas.be>

	* NEWS: added entries for the very first versions of gifc (1.0
	and 1.1).

	* README: update for new files.

	in configure.in).

	* examples/gifcmp.pl: Compare script for GIFs, to be used in
	make check.

	* configure.in: Enhancements related to examples.

	* examples/: Further enhancements in Makefile.am for checking
	multiple gifc files.

1999-04-14  Peter Verthez  <Peter.Verthez@advalvas.be>

	* README: update for new directories.

	* doc/: New directory; gifc.html, gifc.txt and gifc.ref moved to
	doc; Makefile.am in directory doc; 'disthook' target splitted
	between Makefile.am and doc/Makefile.am.

	* examples/: New directory; example.gifc moved to
	examples/piechart.gifc; Makefile.am in directory examples;
	'check' target moved from Makefile.am to examples/Makefile.am.

1999-04-12  Peter Verthez  <Peter.Verthez@advalvas.be>

	* gifc.dist (rotate_and_mirror_image): Optimizations.

	* gifc.dist (init_program): Put the copyright string in the
	configure script for easier maintainability.

	* gifc.dist (do_rectangle): Corrected some error strings.

	* gifc.dist (do_imagemirror): Removed erroneous argument $mirror.

	* gifc.dist (do_textmirror): Removed erroneous argument $mirror.

	* gifc.dist (do_image): Use $command instead of literal "IMAGE" in
	check of subcommands.

	* configure.in: message whether to use pre-processor or not.

1999-04-11  Peter Verthez  <Peter.Verthez@advalvas.be>

	* documentation files: updates

	* gifc.dist: Implemented general rotation and mirroring of text: new
	command TEXTMIRROR; new TEXT subcommands ROTATE and MIRROR; new
	subroutines 'do_textrotate' and 'do_textmirror'; changes in 'do_text';
	initializations in 'init_image'.

	* gifc.dist: Implemented general rotation and mirroring of images: new
	subroutine 'rotate_and_mirror_image'; new command IMAGEMIRROR; new
	IMAGE subcommands ROTATE and MIRROR; new subroutines 'do_imagerotate'
	and 'do_imagemirror'; changes in 'do_image'; initializations in
	'init_image'.

	* gifc.dist (do_image): Corrected bug: check if the filename is
	a subcommand (more generally than presently done) before accepting
	it.

	* gifc.dist (get_unique_color): Changed to get the image as parameter
	(so that it can be called on other images); all calls to this
	function hence must get this parameter.

	* gifc.dist (do_image): Corrected bug: image should be scaled first,
	then the boundaries should be calculated (for image aligning).

1999-04-10  Peter Verthez  <Peter.Verthez@advalvas.be>

	* gifc.dist: Added subroutine 'round', to replace ad-hoc roundings in
	the code.

1999-04-08  Peter Verthez  <Peter.Verthez@advalvas.be>

	* gifc.dist (process_input): Removed 'chdir $inputdir': not
	necessary and sometimes completely wrong.

	* all files: Change to autoconf/automake system.  The option
	-with-pp=ARG is removed (pre-processor is normally in standard
	place, no?)

1999-03-20  Peter Verthez  <Peter.Verthez@advalvas.be>

	* gifc.dist: Implemented INTERLACED command: new entry in the hash
	%keyword_proc; new subroutine 'do_interlaced'.

	* gifc.dist: Implemented closed segments: changes in do_sub_closed
	and do_arc; $closedarc is 1 for PIE and 2 for SEGMENT.

1999-03-13  Peter Verthez  <Peter.Verthez@advalvas.be>

	* release of version 2.6.
	
The basis for this change log file is release 2.6.
