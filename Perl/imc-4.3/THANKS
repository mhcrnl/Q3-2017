imc THANKS file

imc has originally been written by me, Peter Verthez, under impulse of a
contest written out by my former sysadmin at work, Martin Robinson, who
also submitted the original requirements for the program and suggested
various improvements afterwards (note however that the program was not
written under work hours, and so is unrelated to my employer).  And if it
wasn't for my competitor, Donny Janssens, it may not have grown so big so
quickly...

The following people have influenced the later releases of imc, by
reporting problems, suggesting improvements or submitting actual code:

- Francois Lorho (francois.lorho@sandwich.pfizer.com)
- Erik Maryniak (e.maryniak@pobox.com)
- Jean-Dominique Dessaint (jdd@hptnodur.grenoble.hp.com)
- Masuo Gates (zaphod@ipninc.com)
- Kevin Burtch (kburtch@bellsouth.net)
- Weidung Chuang (WChuang@longboard.com)
- Tina Marie (tina@tripacerdriver.com)

Still others have suggested improvements that have not been incorporated
yet.  Maybe later...
