This archive includes all the files you should need.  The files were tar'd and 
gzipped with the appropriate directory structure and permissions.  The directory 
structure should look like this:


public_html/
  gantt/
    all the html and cgi files
    images/
      all the images
    users/      [make sure your web server has write access on this]
      all the users' server-side cookies


The files that you probably need to modify include:
	variables.pl
		docroot
		wwwroot
		admin
		adminEmail
	dbhelp.pl
		require


You will also need CGI.pm and Date::Manip.pm installed on the server.  You
can get both of these from perl.com if you don't already have them.

Once configured, you can test the Gantt tool by going to
http://youserver.com/gantt/   and typing in "test" at the login screen.

Enjoy!
