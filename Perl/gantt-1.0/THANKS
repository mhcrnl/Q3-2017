I wish to thank Seth Goldstein <sgoldstn@uiuc.edu> and Jason R. Govig 
<govig@uiuc.edu>, the original programmers of Gantt Chart at the University of
Illinois who, despite a very busy schedule, provided me with the code and
setup documentation to the original tool at
     http://www.ag.uiuc.edu/~lced/gantt/index.html

Thanks also to Milind Basole <basole@uiuc.edu>, Programmer/Sys. Adm., ITCS at
the College of ACES in University of Illinois for approval to release the code
under the GPL, once revised for public consumption.

Final thanks go to my Creator who gave me enough grasp to learn what I have and
dedicate this to Him.
