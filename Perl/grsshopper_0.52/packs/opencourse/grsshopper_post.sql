So let&apos;s please stop talking about how \"Quebec\" brilliantly chose to give a \"limited endorsement\" to its new government, and other such hogwash.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well, yesterday, a real-life pundit had the same idea. Of course as a professional (and a professor), <a href=\"http://www.canada.com/opinion/columnists/myth%2Bwise%2BQuebec%2Bvoter/7219137/story.html\">William Watson</a> puts the case for more eloquently than I, a humble blogger.

But professional demagogues don&apos;t have to worry about the details, and Malema was fundamentally right in what he said next.</p>\n<p>\"Zuma doesn&apos;t care about the mineworkers, he came here last night and met with whites,\" Malema said. \"It&apos;s not the white British (mine-owners) who were killed. It was you.\" And in a final slap at the governing African National Congress (from which he was recently expelled): \"They only come to you when it&apos;s time for elections. Once you put that cross, they disappear.\"</p>\n<p>Julius Malema fills the same role in today&apos;s South Africa that Winnie Mandela did in the dying days of apartheid in the early 1990s: the radical demagogue who uses violent, often anti-white invective to articulate the rage of the impoverished black majority. This terrifies South Africans who have something to lose, black and white alike.</p>\n<p>Malema preaches hatred of the rich and hints at social revolution. The fact that he has become mysteriously rich himself at the age of 31, although his only jobs were as an official of the ANC Youth League, doesn&apos;t bother his millions of admirers at all. They just want to see a real redistribution of the country&apos;s wealth in their favour, and they think Malema is their best bet.</p>\n<p>They are probably wrong. Malema is ruthless and cunning enough to have a chance at winning power some time towards the end of this decade, when the ANC&apos;s political near-monopoly finally collapses. But he is not skilled enough, and perhaps not even clever enough, to push through that sort of redistribution without destroying South Africa&apos;s industrial economy in the process. Nevertheless, many of the poor feel they have nowhere else to turn.</p>\n<p>It is now 18 years since the fall of apartheid, and a substantial class of prosperous middle-class blacks has emerged (together with a small group of very rich people with close links to the ANC). However, the poor majority remain desperately poor, and they no longer trust the ANC to bring positive change in their lives. They are starting to defect politically, and the main battle is being fought on the territory of the trade unions.</p>\n<p>Mining is South Africa&apos;s biggest industry, and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) is the country&apos;s biggest union. It is closely tied to the ANC, but many believe that it is also in bed with the bosses. Cyril Ramaphosa (who chaired the ANC&apos;s disciplinary appeals committee that expelled Malema from the ANC early this year) was the founder of the NUM 30 years ago, but now he is on Lonmin&apos;s board.</p>\n<p>The Lonmin strike is actually a turf war. The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (ACMU), a new, radical union, has been stealing the members of the National Union of Mineworkers, including three or four thousand of the 26,000 men working in Lonmin&apos;s platinum mine. ACMU promised to triple the workers&apos; wages, and the violence began when it tried to stop NUM members from going to work.</p>\n<p>Ten people were killed in clashes between the two unions in mid-August, including two police who were hacked to death with pangas (machetes). So the police were understandably nervous last week when they faced an angry mob of about 3,000 workers armed with pangas, spears and clubs.</p>\n<p>Unleashing a torrent of automatic fire that killed 34 strikers and wounded 78 was an act of gross indiscipline, but frightened men, even if they have far better weapons, will not always respond in a measured and disciplined way when they are under attack. The reflex, unfortunately, is to hold the trigger down and spray the threat with bullets.</p>\n<p>Nobody wanted this tragedy to occur, and it is unlikely to happen again in the same way. Jacob Zuma will still probably be re-elected as the leader of the ANC in December and go on to a second term as president. There will be a commission of inquiry, and judges will reach conclusions and make recommendations.</p>\n<p>But the main political beneficiaries of the incident are the forces that are trying to loosen the grip of the ANC&apos;s old guard on the unions and the country. It has been a very auspicious occasion for Julius Malema, who is trying to position himself as the only real alternative to Zuma and the gang. Some time later in the decade, the Lonmin massacre may come to be seen as a turning point in South Africa&apos;s history. Or not, because history does not run on rails.</p>\n<p>____________________________________</p>\n<p>To shorten to 725 words, omit paragraphs 5 and .

The New Democrats picked up three points to hit 35%, while the Liberals were down three points to only 17%.<br /><br />That isn&apos;t an all-time low for the Liberals - they were polling even lower than that in the immediate aftermath of the May 2011 election - but this is one of the lower results we&apos;ve seen for the party.<br /><br />The Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois came up fourth with 7%, while the Greens were unchanged at 6%.<br /><br />The shifts in support for the Conservatives and New Democrats are statistically insignificant, but the drop of the Liberals is outside the margin of error for a party with that much support. Perhaps this is not too shocking, considering that the Liberals are still leaderless (and more so than usual, Bob Rae has not been very visible of late).<br /><br />It is worth noting that Abacus used Angus-Reid&apos;s online panel for their polling. Based on the information available in their report, it would appear that Abacus recorded, or at least released, more demographic results than Angus-Reid ever does: Conservatives lead among evangelicals while the NDP leads among non-religious people, for example. It is unclear whether Abacus&apos;s last poll also used Angus-Reid&apos;s panel.<br /><br />Things held very stable in British Columbia and Ontario, with no party losing or gaining more than a point. The New Democrats maintained a five-point advantage in British Columbia, while the Conservatives held firm with an 11-point lead in Ontario. The NDP narrowly edged out the Conservatives in the Prairies, and were up by nine points over the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois in Quebec.

I think Rick is expressing a frustration that a lot of people have with polling right now, but I also think this is being borne out of a bit of a false narrative when it comes to polling. He refers to Alberta, Quebec, and the disappearance of the Bloc as things the polls got wrong. I&apos;ll give him Alberta - that was a disaster. But the problem in Quebec was rather minimal: underscoring the Liberals by a few points in polls taken a few days before the vote. That was hardly a catastrophe.

Perhaps Rick is referring to a site like mine that did not predict that the Bloc would win only four seats, but I don&apos;t think it is fair to say that the polls missed out on the Bloc&apos;s demise.<br /><br />This is something I have heard again and again, that the polls did not anticipate the NDP&apos;s rise in Quebec and the Bloc&apos;s fall. They absolutely did anticipate these things. They didn&apos;t see it coming two or three weeks before the vote, but that is because Quebecers hadn&apos;t swung over to the NDP yet. Polls don&apos;t predict future events, opinions ebb and flow during a campaign and we have seen many examples of that over the past 16 months. But critics of polls never point out their successes, even their recent ones: very good results in Quebec during the federal campaign, a perfect call in Manitoba&apos;s election, good performances in Ontario and Saskatchewan, and decent individual polls in Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland &amp;amp; Labrador. Sure, Alberta was a Dewey-defeats-Truman moment and they could have been better in Quebec, but let&apos;s not throw the baby out with the bathwater.

The New Democrats picked up three points to hit 35%, while the Liberals were down three points to only 17%.<br /><br />That isn&apos;t an all-time low for the Liberals - they were polling even lower than that in the immediate aftermath of the May 2011 election - but this is one of the lower results we&apos;ve seen for the party.<br /><br />The Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois came up fourth with 7%, while the Greens were unchanged at 6%.<br /><br />The shifts in support for the Conservatives and New Democrats are statistically insignificant, but the drop of the Liberals is outside the margin of error for a party with that much support. Perhaps this is not too shocking, considering that the Liberals are still leaderless (and more so than usual, Bob Rae has not been very visible of late).<br /><br />It is worth noting that Abacus used Angus-Reid&apos;s online panel for their polling. Based on the information available in their report, it would appear that Abacus recorded, or at least released, more demographic results than Angus-Reid ever does: Conservatives lead among evangelicals while the NDP leads among non-religious people, for example. It is unclear whether Abacus&apos;s last poll also used Angus-Reid&apos;s panel.<br /><br />Things held very stable in British Columbia and Ontario, with no party losing or gaining more than a point. The New Democrats maintained a five-point advantage in British Columbia, while the Conservatives held firm with an 11-point lead in Ontario.

Journalists are increasingly at the mercy of a \"public editor\" who sits outside the editorial department.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Oh, sweet Christ. The blogosphere didn&#8217;t &#8220;define&#8221; plagiarism. Plagiarism was already defined for us, when we went to school. I know you went to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Corcoran\">a second-rate institution</a> with the endearing nickname of Last Chance U, but I&#8217;m sure it must have come up even there. It&#8217;s a fairly simple principle: if you&#8217;re using someone else&#8217;s words, attribute them. You seem to think this is some random, arbitrary, unfair principle. It isn&#8217;t. You&#8217;re a newspaper columnist. The sole reason you get paid is because people (apparently) want to know what you have to say. If you&#8217;re printing words that were actually written by someone else, and then getting paid for them&#8230; are you honestly telling me you see no problem with this?</p>\n<p>The most disturbing part of it all, though, is the sneering condescension. What Corcoran is telling us, and he hasn&#8217;t been the only one in recent days, is that the media is accountable to no one. It will make &#8212; and break &#8212; its own rules. Readers have no right to expect that when they open the Globe &amp; Mail or the National Post, the words they find there were actually penned by a professional journalist rather than copied-and-pasted from some random website because the reporter in question was too lazy to do their damned job.</p>\n<p>And, according to Corcoran, for me to say otherwise is to engage in &#8220;suppression&#8221; of free speech. It is to engage in an assault on this country&#8217;s cherished freedoms. It is to&#8230; what did he compare it to again? Oh, yes, here&#8217;s what Terence Corcoran of the National Post says it feels like to be subject to a rule that you&#8217;re not allowed to rip off other people&#8217;s work and present it as your own:</p>\n<blockquote><p>something of what it felt like during the Cultural Revolution in China, when ideological enforcers roamed the country to impose their views and expose running-dogs, remove people from their jobs and purge them from the system.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fuck you.</p>\n<p>If this is honestly the best you can come up, then the only meaningful contribution you have left to make to the discussion would be a carefully written letter of resignation.

But not just the pipeline! David Black thinks that if we build a <a href=\"http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Arizona+project+inspires+David+Black/7119135/story.html\">$13 billion refinery in Kitimat</a>, the people of B.C. will support the Northern Gateway pipeline. You see, our environmental concerns will be easily laid aside if we&#8217;re promised a cut of the profits (in the form of jobs). Black also claims that refined fuel products would be less devastating than Albertan bitumen in the event of an ocean spill, which I suppose is true.</p>\n<p>Speaking as someone who was born in British Columbia, I can&#8217;t say enough about the way Black has gone about building support for this project. For instance, so far, he&#8217;s <a href=\"http://kitimatclean.ca/\">created a website</a> for the new refinery which, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll agree, has just about all the bells and whistles you&#8217;d want to put on a website if you were trying to attract billionaire investors to your highly speculative project. I&#8217;ve certainly seen WordPress-based websites with <em>less </em>professionalism, I can tell you that. (Sixth Estate, for instance, is also powered by the free WordPress platform, but his is much, MUCH fancier than mine.)</p>\n<p>Anyhow, the announcement and the company were announced a month ago, but this week Black upped the ante yet again by releasing an opinion poll purporting to show massive support for the new venture. And once again, I have to hand it to him for pulling out all the stops. I&#8217;ve rarely seen an opinion poll, at least one that gets widespread coverage in the Canadian media, done according to a methodology as rigorous, impressive, and all-encompassing as <a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/2012/09/26/publisher-david-black-ups-ante-for-refinery-to-process-northern-gateway-oil/\">this one was</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mr. Black said the poll was conducted by his own company, Black Press Group Ltd.</p>\n<p>The newspaper publisher asked each of its 60 B.C. newspapers to survey 20 random households and placed another 200 calls in locations where it doesn&apos;t own a newspaper. The poll was conducted between Sept. 10 and Sept. 20.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gee. I can&#8217;t imagine what could possibly be wrong with such a poll.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the Black Press website (by my count) lists no less than <a href=\"http://www.blackpress.ca/\">96 publications across British Columbia</a>. I&#8217;m not exactly sure how to explain this discrepancy, but no doubt Black has the job well in hand.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m equally sure that British Columbians will not be troubled by the fact that the owner of a considerable proportion of the province&#8217;s non-Postmedia print media is so heavily involved in a controversial energy project.</p>\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6621\" data-text=\"BC Media Tycoon Puts His Best Efforts into Promoting Enbridge Pipeline\" data-count=\"horizontal\">Tweet</a>',NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1348837044','1',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,'The Sixth Estate','Opinion','Media;Canada','Opinion',NULL,NULL),(42,'link',NULL,'CLC Gains Entry to Za&#039;atari Refugee Camp in Jordan','http://www.canadianlabour.ca/national/news/clc-gains-entry-zaatari-refugee-camp-jordan',NULL,'7',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'\n   Region:&amp;nbsp;\n  \n      \n          National    \n     <p>The Canadian Labour Congress has seen first-hand the effects of the escalating conflict in Syria.

But the degree of inefficiency that Forum assigns to them is a little ridiculous. Forum&apos;s seat projection model would award the Tories 60 seats, the NDP 24, and the Liberals 23. With their own regional results showing the Liberals with no regional concentration of support, it makes very little sense that Forum&apos;s model would still give the Liberals that many seats.

He used to enjoy better approval ratings than the unloved Tim Hudak, but no more. His approval rating dropped nine points to only 20% and his disapproval increased by seven points to 67%. Even among the dwindling number of Liberal supporters his numbers have dropped by six points to 71% approval.<br /><br />That is not to say that Hudak has taken advantage of this. His numbers have held relatively steady, with an approval rating of 26% and a disapproval rating of 49%. The biggest shift came among PC voters - his approval rating was down five points to only 48% among his party&apos;s supporters.<br /><br />Andrea Horwath&apos;s numbers were also rather static, with her approval rating registering 48% and her disapproval rating dropping four points to 23%. Both Hudak and Horwath&apos;s net ratings improved slightly (the gap between approval and disapproval shrunk by three points for Hudak, and increased by six points for Horwath), but this seems to be a case of Ontarians turning against McGuinty rather than towards another party or leader.<br /><br />But as has been the case in the past, it is difficult to know what to believe with this poll. It would not shock me in the slightest if Nanos Research released a new poll showing the New Democrats with less than 25% support and the Liberals and Tories still in a close race. The increase in NDP support has not been replicated at the federal level either, with the exception of a new poll by Environics. Aside from their results, the NDP is still hovering around 30% in the province (including in the most recent federal Forum poll) and hasn&apos;t experienced any sort of dramatic leap.<br /><br />Ontario remains a province to keep a close eye on, but the trends are not exactly clear.

This random killing to create fear is precisely what we call terrorism when somebody else does it.<br /><br />On p. 1, Brent Mazerolle - well - I can kindly call this misleading reporting.<br /><br />The lead story \"Are we correct or cranky\" is about a survey which shows that Monctonians are profoundly unhappy with the quality of city services.

Just a lot of cranks live here.)<br /><br />The focus is supposed to be on whether Moncton is a good place to raise children.

But the TandT itself has taken a lead in saying this is not a good place to raise children. Now Brent writes off such critics as cranks. In fact, the only cranks I have seen write for the TandT.<br /><br />Bad reporting, Brent.<br /><br />Otherwise, Section A is a great read for lovers of car ads.<br /><br />NewsToday leads with a silly story about Trudeau, and how good looks are important in choosing a party leader. That&apos;s drivel. The line-up of Canadian prime ministers since 1867 will never be confused with the Mr. Canada contest. John A was homely. The longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history was Mackenzie-King who was short, overweight, homely as a post, utterly without charm, and without friends. Despite a lifetime search, he could never find a wife or even a girlfriend. John Diefenbaker? He may have sired an illegitimate son. But lots of homely people do that.<br /><br />Similarly, Belliveau gushes over Justin Trudeau, even over his very ordinary and rather scattered academic record. Belliveau also has a strange comment about the father and son. \"Justin Trudeau is a young man in tune with the times. He is not his father.\" &amp;nbsp;?????????<br /><br />Pierre Trudeau was not in tune with the times? And what the hell does being in tune with the times mean? What principles does Justin Trudeau stand for? Belliveau appears to be linking that statement to Justin&apos;s attitude to oil and shale gas development. Yessirree, maybe being in tune with the times means making all the money we can now without worrying about what the means for the world our children (and even most of us) will have to live in - maybe.<br /><br />Incidentally, Pierre Trudeau was neither handsome nor outgoing. He was, in fact, a very shy man, quite an introvert. But he could turn on an extroverted, take-charge personality as if by a switch.

In fact, it&apos;s not just a leader they need. It&apos;s some sense of what \"Liberal\" means.<br /><br />P. B7 has a story on how our provincial minister of mines and energy, Craig Leonard, is not in a conflict of interest, even though his sister has a senior position in the petroleum industry. (Mr. Leonard has said he wants to make New Brunswick an energy hub with --- well, guess --- firewood? &amp;nbsp;rubber bands? candles? shale gas?<br /><br /><br />Nope. No conflict of interest there. But read the article closely. It&apos;s so garbled that it&apos;s hard to follow. Are their rules for conflict of interest? &amp;nbsp;Does Mr. Allward have any moral or political position on this? I mean, he is the person who chooses ministers. If he thinks any choice is a bad idea, he has the power not to make it.&amp;nbsp;<br />But I can see the political appeal of Mr. Leonard. &amp;nbsp;The story ends with a &amp;nbsp;long statement from Mr. Leonard. And, oh, and can this guy talk political gobbledygook. You could cut out at least half of his words without changing the meaning. In fact, you could boil the whole thing down to four words. He likes shale gas.<br /><br />Oh! Something else the TandT forgot to report. It was announced yesterday that a group in New York had awarded the Richard Nixon prize to Harper. The prize is for courageous and strong leadership in protecting the interests of the rich and powerful.<br /><br />I remember the days, not that long ago, when Canada was one of the most respected &amp;nbsp;(if innocuous) countries in the world. Harper has singlehandedly destroyed that. In a recent South American poll of popular political leaders in the Americas, Harper came in 18th.<br /><br />In particular, his policy toward Israel is confusing, to say the least. Until today, he was holding to an Israel policy that seemed in conflict with that of Obama, and far closer to Netanyahu&apos;s demands for war. Indeed, Netanyahu, who is barely on speaking terms with Obama, sat down yesterday for a real kiss-up with Harper.<br /><br />I have been wondering for some time why Canada was following a policy that seemed to be a contradiction of Obama&apos;s. But today, Harper&apos;s on p. 1 playing kiss-kiss with Netanyahu while refusing to accept Netanyahu&apos;s demand for a red line against Iran. <br /><br />That&apos;s the same as Obama&apos;s policy. Yet Netanyahu is smiling and going kiss-kiss back on Harper.<br /><br />What&apos;s going on here? Why is Netanyahu furious with Obama but buddies with Harper?<br /><br />We are quite possibly on the edge of World War Three. Shouldn&apos;t we be thinking our way through to some clearer policy?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />5<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/373697047018228084-6720807068766300323?l=themonctongrimes-dripdrain.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',NULL,'Who&apos;s got the button?<br /><br />There was sort of a big story on CBC news yesterday.

The prize is for courageous and strong leadership in protecting the interests of the rich and powerful.<br /><br />I remember the days, not that long ago, when Canada was one of the most respected &amp;nbsp;(if innocuous) countries in the world. Harper has singlehandedly destroyed that. In a recent South American poll of popular political leaders in the Americas, Harper came in 18th.<br /><br />In particular, his policy toward Israel is confusing, to say the least. Until today, he was holding to an Israel policy that seemed in conflict with that of Obama, and far closer to Netanyahu&apos;s demands for war. Indeed, Netanyahu, who is barely on speaking terms with Obama, sat down yesterday for a real kiss-up with Harper.<br /><br />I have been wondering for some time why Canada was following a policy that seemed to be a contradiction of Obama&apos;s. But today, Harper&apos;s on p. 1 playing kiss-kiss with Netanyahu while refusing to accept Netanyahu&apos;s demand for a red line against Iran. <br /><br />That&apos;s the same as Obama&apos;s policy. Yet Netanyahu is smiling and going kiss-kiss back on Harper.<br /><br />What&apos;s going on here? Why is Netanyahu furious with Obama but buddies with Harper?<br /><br />We are quite possibly on the edge of World War Three. Shouldn&apos;t we be thinking our way through to some clearer policy?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />5<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/373697047018228084-6720807068766300323?l=themonctongrimes-dripdrain.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1348939443','2',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,'The Moncton Times@Transcript - Good and Bad','Opinion','City','Opinion',NULL,NULL),(279,'link',NULL,'Sept. 28: Big stories in the news...','http://themonctongrimes-dripdrain.blogspot.com/2012/09/sept-28-big-stories-in-news.html',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Headline, p. 1: Read all about it.<br />\"Moncton Wal-Mart to become &amp;nbsp;Supercentre\"<br />\"Moncton Hospital to open area for smoking\" &amp;nbsp; ( outdoors).<br />p.

Professional journalism certainly does have an originality problem. But that&#8217;s not what&#8217;s at issue here. We&#8217;re not accusing Wente of merely &#8220;relying too heavily on the work of others&#8221; (although she does that, too). Wente stands accused of plagiarism. Plagiarism isn&#8217;t just a lack of being original: it&#8217;s lifting material without attribution and/or quotes, and thus presenting it as though it were your own words. This is not, contrary to what one National Post columnist recently claimed, a new definition cooked up by radical bloggers. It&#8217;s bog-standard. It&#8217;s older than Wente.</p>\n<p>What <em>is </em>at issue is that, in addition to originality, professional journalism has a plagiarism problem. It has a plagiarism problem because some high-profile columnists allegedly plagiarize and, when this happens, other high-profile columnists sally forth in defence of their colleague, trumping up any number of pathetic and contradictory excuses: journalists are busy, the Internet makes it easy to copy and paste, there isn&#8217;t enough editorial supervision, there&#8217;s too <em>much</em> editorial supervision, it&#8217;s because young people don&#8217;t follow the same rules as their parents, it&#8217;s blah blah blah.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t good enough. It&#8217;s the 21st century, and the media is accountable to the people it serves. We <strong>demand </strong>that you hold yourself to certain standards, one of which is that you present the work of others as your own. Failing to provide full citations for every idea that ends up on the page is fine. Lifting sentences verbatim is <strong>not</strong> fine. Most of you are university graduates. Didn&#8217;t this come up at least once or twice in whatever institutions you got your degree from?</p>\n<p>McBride closes with what must be the least imaginative proposal for solutions ever:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Today&apos;s most original successful writers often combine the new and the old to foster their thinking.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s brilliant.</p>\n<p>While we&#8217;re on the subject of &#8220;originality breakdowns,&#8221; it&#8217;s worth <a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/09/27/editorial-oversight-globe-issues-new-mea-culpa-after-columnist-leah-mclaren-writes-article-trying-to-sell-her-house/\">pointing out</a> that a few days ago one of the Globe&#8217;s real estate columnists, Leah McLaren, blatantly used her <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/home-and-garden/real-estate/home-of-the-week-a-workers-cottage-built-for-family-life/article4556636/\">&#8220;Home of the Week&#8221; column to advertise her <strong>own </strong>home</a>, which is for sale. Just like Margaret Wente, the Globe&#8217;s editors are treating this appalling ethical lapse with the utmost seriousness.

The general tenor of commentary from pundits like those described above is that professional journalists are above accountability, that readers do not have the right to complain about their (apparent lack of) professional standards, and that they are simply far too busy and postmodern to be bothered by silly rules like &#8220;don&#8217;t plagiarize.&#8221; Ironically, in choosing to back their own rather than to defend their collective reputation, many of Canada&#8217;s journalists are implying what some of us believed all along: that for all our various faults, <strong>political bloggers actually have higher standards than professional reporters</strong>.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, I couldn&#8217;t think of much I could do, especially on my own. But I can do the following, as meaningless and trivial as it may be, and I encourage other bloggers to adopt this statement of principles as well (or at least to consider what other measures they will take):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When I mention a journalist who has repeatedly lifted material without attribution, especially from fellow bloggers, I will always add that fact in brackets, preferably with a link explaining why. For instance: Margaret Wente (<a href=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6606\">a documented plagiarist</a>). I&#8217;m considering whether the same thing should apply to any media organization that continues to employ plagiarists, across the board.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>When I mention a journalist who has defended plagiarism by fellow reporters, I will always state that fact, in line with the above. For instance: Terence Corcoran (who <a href=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6627\">defends plagiarism by fellow journalists</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>I will not link to any column by any plagiarist or defender of plagiarism, ever. If I feel the need to write about their columns, I will do so, as I have on many occasions before. I may write about it positively, when I think they&#8217;ve written something of decent quality. I may even quote from them, where appropriate. But no link juice. The moment you decided to defend plagiarism was the moment you exempted yourself from the privilege of full participation in the online community.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So far, the reporters I will be treating in this fashion are: <a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/09/25/margaret-wente-suspended-from-cbc-media-panel-after-plagiarism-row-over-globe-column/\">Margaret Wente</a> (obviously) of the <em>Globe &amp; Mail</em>, <a href=\"http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/09/24/margaret-wente-remix-artist/\">Jesse Brown</a> of Maclean&#8217;s, <a href=\"http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/09/27/terence-corcoran-on-margaret-wente-why-we-dont-need-public-editors/\">Terence Corcoran</a> of the National Post, <a href=\"http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/09/26/dan-delmar-self-righteous-sinners-cast-the-first-stone-at-margaret-wente/\">Dan Delmar</a> of the Post (and elsewhere), and <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1262116--tim-harper-the-perils-of-mainstream-journalism-in-the-social-media-era\">Tim Harper</a> of the Toronto Star.

However it lacks one important facet: a fantasy league. With the uncertainty about whether or not my friends and I could carry out our dreams as armchair General Managers for fantasy hockey in the National Hockey League (NHL), we decided to jump ship to the United Kingdom&apos;s premier hockey league.</p> <hr /> <p><a href=\"http://argosy.mta.ca/index.php?q=article/knee-deep-eihl-hockey\"><strong>Click here for the original story from The Argosy</strong></a></p> <hr /> <p>So on the opening day of the EIHL season two friends of mine: Marshall Thomas and Bryce Works from St. Albert, Alberta and Belmont, NS respectively created the first annual EIHL Fantasy Hockey League. With team names like \"Five for Tea Time\" (Marshall), \"London Silly Nannies\" (Bryce), and the \"Titty Ho Express\" (myself) we dived head first into the world of English hockey. Titty Ho is an actual town name in England. Google it.</p> <p>How were our teams selected? We each get to choose two goalies (standard) but the forwards and defence get a bit trickier. We picked six forwards and four defencemen and tracked their point totals. Since the league is apparently full of players who like to beat the crap out of each other (this year&apos;s leader in penalty minutes through five games is American Hockey League dropout Benn Olson with 99), we also picked an additional three forwards and two defencemen to score points based solely on penalty minutes, with players gaining a point for every five penalty minutes.</p> <p>The EIHL has no big name talent. Heck, games are on weekends and the players hold down part-time jobs in the week. Regardless I developed a solid system for selecting my players. I was happy to take Stuart MacRae from Sydney, Nova Scotia who played with the Devils. These Devils weren&apos;t from New Jersey, they are from Cardiff. I also selected a forward to count penalty minutes who happened too be named Jeff Hutchins, only because his name sort of resembled Geoff Hutchinson, my co-worker at <em>The Argosy</em> last year.</p> <p>I also picked Sylvain Cloutier based on the fact that he is related to former Vancouver Canucks goaltender Dan Cloutier. One also can&apos;t forget the Israeli superstar Maxim Birbraer who is currently the only player from the Middle Eastern country to be drafted in the NHL (the New Jersey Devils drafted him sixty-seventh overall in 2000.) The steal of the draft went to Marshall as he randomly discovered that former Moncton Wildcats goaltender Nicola Riopel signed with the Dundee Stars.</p> <p>Of course this league isn&apos;t perfect and my lack of knowledge on the league made my team suffer. My top defenceman, Jeff Mason was supposed to carry my defensive core. Nope, turns out he&apos;s playing in Switzerland this year, whoops.</p> <p>Are we crazy? Maybe, but we need our fantasy hockey fix. Lockout or no lockout, we are going to satisfy our our fantasy hockey craving.

All aboard the Titty Ho Express!</p> <p>-30-</p>\n   ',NULL,'\n<p><strong></strong></h2><p>Sports</strong></p><p><strong>Robert Murray - CUP Sports Editor</strong></p><p>SACKVILLE (CUP) - The Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL) has most of the things you&apos;d expect a hockey league to have: rinks, teams, players, money and the best thing about hockey, hockey. However it lacks one important facet: a fantasy league. With the uncertainty about whether or not my friends and I could carry out our dreams as armchair General Managers for fantasy hockey in the National Hockey League (NHL), we decided to jump ship to the United Kingdom&apos;s premier hockey league.</p> <hr /> <p><a href=\"http://argosy.mta.ca/index.php?q=article/knee-deep-eihl-hockey\"><strong>Click here for the original story from The Argosy</strong></a></p> <hr /> <p>So on the opening day of the EIHL season two friends of mine: Marshall Thomas and Bryce Works from St. Albert, Alberta and Belmont, NS respectively created the first annual EIHL Fantasy Hockey League. With team names like \"Five for Tea Time\" (Marshall), \"London Silly Nannies\" (Bryce), and the \"Titty Ho Express\" (myself) we dived head first into the world of English hockey. Titty Ho is an actual town name in England. Google it.</p> <p>How were our teams selected? We each get to choose two goalies (standard) but the forwards and defence get a bit trickier. We picked six forwards and four defencemen and tracked their point totals. Since the league is apparently full of players who like to beat the crap out of each other (this year&apos;s leader in penalty minutes through five games is American Hockey League dropout Benn Olson with 99), we also picked an additional three forwards and two defencemen to score points based solely on penalty minutes, with players gaining a point for every five penalty minutes.</p> <p>The EIHL has no big name talent. Heck, games are on weekends and the players hold down part-time jobs in the week. Regardless I developed a solid system for selecting my players. I was happy to take Stuart MacRae from Sydney, Nova Scotia who played with the Devils. These Devils weren&apos;t from New Jersey, they are from Cardiff. I also selected a forward to count penalty minutes who happened too be named Jeff Hutchins, only because his name sort of resembled Geoff Hutchinson, my co-worker at <em>The Argosy</em> last year.</p> <p>I also picked Sylvain Cloutier based on the fact that he is related to former Vancouver Canucks goaltender Dan Cloutier. One also can&apos;t forget the Israeli superstar Maxim Birbraer who is currently the only player from the Middle Eastern country to be drafted in the NHL (the New Jersey Devils drafted him sixty-seventh overall in 2000.) The steal of the draft went to Marshall as he randomly discovered that former Moncton Wildcats goaltender Nicola Riopel signed with the Dundee Stars.</p> <p>Of course this league isn&apos;t perfect and my lack of knowledge on the league made my team suffer. My top defenceman, Jeff Mason was supposed to carry my defensive core. Nope, turns out he&apos;s playing in Switzerland this year, whoops.</p> <p>Are we crazy? Maybe, but we need our fantasy hockey fix. Lockout or no lockout, we are going to satisfy our our fantasy hockey craving. The powers that be can take away our hockey but just like in 2004-05 we will find alternatives.</p> <p>Instead of watching the Washington Capitals we&apos;ll watch the Edinburgh Capitals, the Florida Panthers become the Nottingham Panthers, and the Philadelphia Flyers become the Fife Flyers. It&apos;s as simple as that. Over there, players aren&apos;t doing it for the money - some of them are even coaches.</p> <p>I think this is just the beginning for EIHL Fantasy hockey.

I have seen Moslems in this city; so there must be at least a prayer group for Moslems.<br /><br />As well, church attendance figures suggest a large number of atheists (also a faith of sorts) and agnostics. All of these represent views about faith. The sports page wouldn&apos;t dream of leaving out the complete scores for a sports league in southern California that nobody here will ever see. But the Faith page leaves out well over 90% of all those who might be interested in faith, if not in specific churches.<br /><br />But there&apos;s also a far, far deeper problem.<br /><br />We live in a world in which the very concepts of right and wrong have pretty much disappeared. A century ago, the world&apos;s leading nations held conferences to limit the use of some of the terrible weapons being developed. Then came World War One, and all limits were abandoned. Today, when weapons are a million times more terrible than they were in 1914, the major nations are the leaders in refusing to consider any limitation on what they can use or do.<br /><br />When the UN was founded, no major nation took it seriously. The veto was placed in its constitution by the major powers to ensure that the UN could never be effective. In the early days, the leading user of the veto was the Soviet Union. I can remember, as a child, hearing jokes about Nyet (no) being the only word the Soviets understood.<br /><br />The did it because they were so often in a minority position. But things have changed.<br /><br />The US is now the big user of the veto. (Though I haven&apos;t heard any jokes about it in our press - or even much mention of it.) As well, it is some of the most self-righteous Christians in the very Christian United States that most loudly shout for even more killing.<br /><br />Canada was one of the last to abandon the UN. The abandonment began a long time ago, but was clear when Canadian pms, starting with Martin, accepted NATO as a respectable cover for unrespectable wars. NATO has replaced the UN; and NATO is simply the US thug for its wars - just as the British Empire provided thugs for the Boer War.<br /><br />War has risen to such a level of savagery and deliberate killing of civilians and and torture and &amp;nbsp;terrorism (yes, by all sides), that Hitler now seems the outstanding figure of the twentieth century who set the model for our time.<br /><br />Nor does not the concept of right and wrong exist in our business world. Oh, yes, business will give big cheques to worthy groups; you can see the photos any day in the TandT. But that&apos;s just good advertising. The reality is that big business, especially, does not operate according to any principles of right and wrong.<br /><br />Quite the contrary, It has long about accepted as its only principle that the only good is making a profit, no matter what the damage to humans or the environment they have to live in. There is an open worship of greed. Greed is good. Greed creates ambition. Greed creates prosperity. (Just look around the world, and check out the prosperity in Haiti, Congo, Somalia, Iraq, Yemen, Greece, Spain, Ireland, Britain, the US....and maybe us.)<br /><br />Look at the corruption in governments. Look at how democracy is becoming a myth. Look at how all those millions were donated to contractors to rebuild Haiti - and now all of it is gone into the pockets of the contractors - with Haitians still living in poverty and filth. Look at the great pharmaceutical companies which insist top retail prices for life-saving drugs sent to third world countries with our tax dollars.<br /><br />Corporations have become unspeakably corrupt and corrupting, greedy, destructive,even &amp;nbsp;murderous (ask the Congolese, Libyans, Iraqis and Afghanis about it) - and they see that as normal, sensible business practice.<br /><br />Incidentally, to see the stupidity in all this, think of the argument given for fracking. Sure, it made do irreparable damage to the environment. But it will create jobs. Yeah. (For a little while. Maybe.) That&apos;s a great idea. Building on it, lets nuke Fredericton. It would kill some people; but so do other attacks on the environment - like fracking. And - here&apos;s the good part.Nuking Fredericton would create jobs with federal money pouring in to clean up Fredericton. For Pete&apos;s sake, grow up. Stop worrying about damage. Think jobs.<br /><br />I have no intention to beat the drum for any religion in particular. I really don&apos;t care whether Jesus was the son of God, or Mary a Virgin. I think the discrimination directed against gays is the product of narrow and self-righteous minds which have missed the whole point of Christianity.<br /><br />As to faith, I have it. Three cheers for me. But that in no way makes me superior to or even seriously different from many devout people I have known who were Jews, Moslems, Hindus or followers of Confucius. &amp;nbsp;Or, for that matter, from a great many agnostics and atheists.<br /><br />But the fact remains that religion has, throughout history, been the source off what sense of right and wrong that we have. Even my favourite atheists have a sense of right and wrong that bears a remarkable resemblance to religious people I have known.<br /><br />(Yes, I know that some of the worst warhawks and preachers of hatred are religious Christians. I think here of the Protestant chaplain in Afghanistan who assured our troops they were doing an important job. I admit we do face a problem of converting Christians to Christianity.)<br /><br />We&apos;re in trouble. We live in a world that is destroying itself for lack of any sense of right and wrong. We live in a capitalist economy which is destroying itself for lack of any sense of right and wrong. In fact, our capitalism has become no different from Stalin&apos;s communism. Like Stalin&apos;s communism, it is simply power, corruption, greed concentrated in the hands of a few. And, like Stalin&apos;s communism, it is destroying itself - and us with it.<br /><br />Whether you are religious or not, we are in severe danger from our lack of any sense of right and wrong.<br /><br />It seems to m the Faith page would be a good place to start considering that - with all the faiths; and, indeed, with all the non-faiths and phony faiths that characterize our big-business and political worlds.<br /><br /><img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/373697047018228084-2453233390479718543?l=themonctongrimes-dripdrain.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',NULL,'I always check out the faith pages (both of them) in the weekend TandT.

The reality is that big business, especially, does not operate according to any principles of right and wrong.<br /><br />Quite the contrary, It has long about accepted as its only principle that the only good is making a profit, no matter what the damage to humans or the environment they have to live in. There is an open worship of greed. Greed is good. Greed creates ambition. Greed creates prosperity. (Just look around the world, and check out the prosperity in Haiti, Congo, Somalia, Iraq, Yemen, Greece, Spain, Ireland, Britain, the US....and maybe us.)<br /><br />Look at the corruption in governments. Look at how democracy is becoming a myth. Look at how all those millions were donated to contractors to rebuild Haiti - and now all of it is gone into the pockets of the contractors - with Haitians still living in poverty and filth. Look at the great pharmaceutical companies which insist top retail prices for life-saving drugs sent to third world countries with our tax dollars.<br /><br />Corporations have become unspeakably corrupt and corrupting, greedy, destructive,even &amp;nbsp;murderous (ask the Congolese, Libyans, Iraqis and Afghanis about it) - and they see that as normal, sensible business practice.<br /><br />Incidentally, to see the stupidity in all this, think of the argument given for fracking. Sure, it made do irreparable damage to the environment. But it will create jobs. Yeah. (For a little while. Maybe.) That&apos;s a great idea. Building on it, lets nuke Fredericton. It would kill some people; but so do other attacks on the environment - like fracking. And - here&apos;s the good part.Nuking Fredericton would create jobs with federal money pouring in to clean up Fredericton. For Pete&apos;s sake, grow up. Stop worrying about damage. Think jobs.<br /><br />I have no intention to beat the drum for any religion in particular. I really don&apos;t care whether Jesus was the son of God, or Mary a Virgin. I think the discrimination directed against gays is the product of narrow and self-righteous minds which have missed the whole point of Christianity.<br /><br />As to faith, I have it. Three cheers for me. But that in no way makes me superior to or even seriously different from many devout people I have known who were Jews, Moslems, Hindus or followers of Confucius. &amp;nbsp;Or, for that matter, from a great many agnostics and atheists.<br /><br />But the fact remains that religion has, throughout history, been the source off what sense of right and wrong that we have. Even my favourite atheists have a sense of right and wrong that bears a remarkable resemblance to religious people I have known.<br /><br />(Yes, I know that some of the worst warhawks and preachers of hatred are religious Christians. I think here of the Protestant chaplain in Afghanistan who assured our troops they were doing an important job. I admit we do face a problem of converting Christians to Christianity.)<br /><br />We&apos;re in trouble. We live in a world that is destroying itself for lack of any sense of right and wrong. We live in a capitalist economy which is destroying itself for lack of any sense of right and wrong. In fact, our capitalism has become no different from Stalin&apos;s communism. Like Stalin&apos;s communism, it is simply power, corruption, greed concentrated in the hands of a few. And, like Stalin&apos;s communism, it is destroying itself - and us with it.<br /><br />Whether you are religious or not, we are in severe danger from our lack of any sense of right and wrong.<br /><br />It seems to m the Faith page would be a good place to start considering that - with all the faiths; and, indeed, with all the non-faiths and phony faiths that characterize our big-business and political worlds.<br /><br /><img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/373697047018228084-2453233390479718543?l=themonctongrimes-dripdrain.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1349019604','2',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,'The Moncton Times@Transcript - Good and Bad','Opinion','City','Opinion',NULL,'The Moncton Times@Transcript - Good and Bad'),(305,'link',NULL,'How the Media Should Handle a Plagiarism Scandal','http://sixthestate.net/?p=6653',NULL,'3',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'In recent days I&#8217;ve done what I can to show readers how horrendously the national media is coping with the news that one of its own, accomplished Globe &#38; Mail columnist Margaret Wente, plagiarizes in her columns.

It hasn&#8217;t been pretty. First, the Globe unsuccessfully tried to dismiss the accusations as the <a href=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6594\">rantings of an anonymous blogger</a>. Later, reporters from other media offered a wide range of excuses for Wente, ranging from the intriguing thesis that <a href=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6606\">plagiarism is obsolete in the Internet age</a> to the rather ridiculous claim that accusing a reporter of plagiarism is akin to the <a href=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6627\">Maoist purges of the Cultural Revolution</a>. It&#8217;s bad enough that I&#8217;ve started a <a href=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6632\">link boycott of pro-plagiarism columnists</a>, and I encourage other bloggers to join me in this protest.</p>\n<p>However, I also want to highlight the ways in which it&#8217;s not all bad news. Some reporters &#8212; some rare few &#8212; have actually done their jobs over the last few days and, more importantly, have decided to put the reputation of their profession ahead of their desire to protect their own from public criticism. For instance, the CBC has taken the important step of <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1262202--cbc-suspends-margaret-wente-from-media-panel-following-plagiarism-allegations\">publicly booting Wente</a> from her position on a media panel while the allegations are investigated. The Globe &amp; Mail, notably, did not announce anything of the kind, although the fact that Wente hasn&#8217;t published another column since a paranoid semi-apology several days ago may be an indication that she&#8217;s on some sort of leave.</p>\n<p>Another thing the Globe didn&#8217;t do was to give a platform to the blogger at <a href=\"http://mediaculpapost.blogspot.ca/\">Media Culpa</a>, an Ottawa art professor named Carol Wainio, to explain her views. (Instead, it apparently preferred to engage in cheap shots at her reputation, at least until this was no longer a tenable position.) In contrast, the <a href=\"http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/09/28/carol-wainio-sorry-wente-and-corcoran-media-ethics-do-matter/\">National Post has done so</a>. It&#8217;s highly recommended reading, because she explains her motives for going after Wente, and simply because the Post was willing to give her the space. A <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1262167--blogger-carol-wainio-a-very-serious-professional-person\">Toronto Star interview</a> is also worth reading, for the same reason.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Star is also to be commended for having its public editor publish a piece on plagiarism which at least <strong>appears</strong> to take the problem seriously. This of course stands in marked contrast to the Globe public editor&#8217;s attempt to downplay the allegations, and the National Post&#8217;s blatant lack of a public editor in the first place (because, according to one of its leading columnists, media accountability is an assault on freedom of the press). <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/opinion/publiceditor/article/1263843--globe-plagiarism-scandal-a-test-for-public-editor\">Kathy English lays out what she thinks</a> are some of the key differences between how her office works at the Star, and how the public editor office works at the Globe &amp; Mail.</p>\n<p>Of course we shouldn&#8217;t kid ourselves about what&#8217;s going on here. The Globe&#8217;s decision to defend one of its high-profile columnists was sadly predictable. So is the willingness of the Globe&#8217;s competitors to slam it at any opportunity &#8212; and this is certainly the opportunity. The delayed response occurred because their instinct to rush in with swords drawn has been warring with a fear that there might be plagiarists in their own organizations who could be exposed. In contrast, the seemingly pro-plagiarism positions taken by people like Terence Corcoran at the Post and Jesse Brown at Maclean&#8217;s are at least principled, even if the principles they hold to are sometimesÂ asinine and contemptible.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, I await a full andÂ sincere expression of contrition from Ms. Wente, one that doesn&#8217;t wander off into gratuitous attacks on her critics.</p>\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6653\" data-text=\"How the Media Should Handle a Plagiarism Scandal\" data-count=\"horizontal\">Tweet</a>',NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1349019664','2',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,'The Sixth Estate','Opinion','Media;Margaret Wente;Canada','Opinion',NULL,'The Sixth Estate'),(306,'link',NULL,'Wildcats downed by the Dogs','http://www.moncton-wildcats.com/article/wildcats-downed-by-the-dogs',NULL,'1',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1349047924','2',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,'News','Press Release','Sports','News',NULL,'News'),(307,'link',NULL,'Moncton dam project is $8M over budget','http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2012/10/01/nb-moncton-dam-project-costs-751.html?cmp=rss',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<img width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"http://www.cbc.ca/gfx/images/news/topstories/2012/03/16/hi-nb-moncton-council-6col.jpg\"><br/><p>The cost of Moncton&apos;s new Tower Road dam and reservoir project in Turtle Creek is $8 million over budget, a 20 per cent increase over its original forecast.</p>',NULL,'<img width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"http://www.cbc.ca/gfx/images/news/topstories/2012/03/16/hi-nb-moncton-council-6col.jpg\"><br/><p>The cost of Moncton&apos;s new Tower Road dam and reservoir project in Turtle Creek is $8 million over budget, a 20 per cent increase over its original forecast.</p>',NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1349091604','2',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,'CBC | New Brunswick News','News','City','News',NULL,'CBC | New Brunswick News');
