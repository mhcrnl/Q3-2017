The B.C. Liberals picked up three points to hit 32%, while the B.C. Conservatives were down four points to 12%. The Greens remained stable at 6% support.<br /><br />The changes in support for the NDP and Liberals were statistically insignificant - not so for the drop of the Conservatives. With a very difficult weekend for the party (low turnout in the vote on leadership, a less-than-impressive win for Cummins, and the loss of their only MLA, John van Dongen) it will be interesting to see if the Conservatives will lose further support.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.threehundredeight.com/2012/09/partisan-language-and-interpreting-polls.html\">As I discussed yesterday</a>, the 32% support for the B.C. Liberals is deceptively high. Compared to Angus-Reid and Forum Research, the two other firms most active in the province, Ipsos-Reid has awarded the Liberals higher scores to the tune of about six points per poll. That is not to say that the B.C. Liberals are not at 32% - Ipsos could be gauging the B.C. electorate more accurately than their rivals - simply that things have remained relatively stable for the Liberals over the summer.<br /><br />In any case, no matter who is doing the polling the end result is a massive NDP landslide. Voter turnout is unlikely to swing things dramatically either, as the New Democrats have majority support among those aged 35 or older in this poll. Those are the people who are most likely to vote on Election Day.<br /><br />Interestingly, though, the New Democrats are not doing so well among men. While they held a 33-point lead among women (57% to 24%), they were only up by a single point among men (41% to 40%). This could be a mere statistical fluke, but it does have the potential to be problematic for Adrian Dix.<br /><br />The New Democrats held leads in Metropolitan Vancouver (52% to 32%) and on Vancouver Island (57% to 24%), having gained three and four points, respectively, since June. The Liberals were steady in these two regions.<br /><br />In the North and the Interior, however, the New Democrats were down five points to 40% while the Liberals were up eight to 36%. This is the only region of the province where the NDP lead is not statistically significant. We saw similar numbers in the recent Angus-Reid poll, suggesting that this part of British Columbia will be the most competitive. It is also the region where the B.C. Conservatives have the most support.

New Democrats would win a majority government of 64 seats. The B.C. Liberals would form the Official Opposition with 20, and one independent would be elected. The B.C. Conservatives would be shut-out, just short of where they need to be to win a couple of seats.<br /><br />The problem could indeed be John Cummins. His personal numbers are far below those of Adrian Dix and even Christy Clark. Whereas Clark has an approval rating of 33%, Cummins&apos; is only 23%. He has a much lower disapproval rating at 40% to Clark&apos;s 60%, but that is due primarily to the 37% of British Columbians who are unsure of their opinion of him. Remove them from the equation (and the 7% who are unsure of Clark), and you get very similar numbers.<br /><br />Dix has better numbers than his party, with an approval rating of 51% and a disapproval rating of only 34%. He is also the favourite person to be Premier at 35% to Clark&apos;s 22% and Cummins&apos; 9%. But these numbers may not be as telling as they appear - if we remove the \"don&apos;t knows\" we get numbers that are almost identical to the voting intention results.<br /><br />Less than eight months remain before British Columbians go to the polls and the B.C. Liberals have been unable to move the dial by more than a tick or two (in either direction) for quite some time. Eight months ago, the B.C. New Democrats were enjoying a 14-point lead over the Liberals. That lead is now between 17 and 21 points.

Forum Research and Nanos Research are both active in the province and they both consistently show completely different results. They both had decent showings in the 2011 provincial election, and there really isn&apos;t any other firm active in the province to provide a better idea of who has it right. They are so different that a \"somewhere in between\" reading of the polls is not very useful.<br />A poll that was released earlier this week, conducted by Forum for the Broadview Strategy Group, further muddied the waters as it gave the NDP a one-point lead over the Tories (36% to 35%), with the Liberals at only 22%.

The New Democrats were down five points to 27%, transforming a one-point edge into a seven-point deficit.<br /><br />The Liberals were up one point to 24%, while the Greens were unchanged at 7% support.<br /><br />This is a change of fortunes for the New Democrats. They have not trailed the Conservatives by seven points since Thomas Mulcair became leader of the party at the end of March. The shifts in support for the Tories and the NDP since June are statistically significant, as are the shifts in Ontario. There, the Conservatives were up six points to 39% while the New Democrats dropped nine points to 23%, putting them well behind the Liberals, unchanged at 29%. If that is a true depiction of what is going on in Ontario, the New Democrats are in a lot of trouble.<br /><br />Shifts elsewhere were within the margin of error. The New Democrats led in Quebec with 31% (-5), followed by the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois at 25% (+4) and the Liberals at 24% (+5). The Tories and NDP were tied in British Columbia with 33% apiece, while the Conservatives led in Alberta and the Prairies. Atlantic Canada is a close race between the New Democrats and the Liberals.<br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WPFkGknSef0/UFhuAqQIASI/AAAAAAAAKdg/hbHG2M01q7E/s1600/HD+Seats.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"202\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WPFkGknSef0/UFhuAqQIASI/AAAAAAAAKdg/hbHG2M01q7E/s400/HD+Seats.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>In terms of seats, these numbers would deliver 152 to the Conservatives on the proposed boundaries of the new 338-seat electoral map. The New Democrats would win 96, the Liberals 74, the Bloc 15 (official party status returns) and the Greens one.<br /><br />The poor showing of the NDP in Ontario is the primary problem for the party in this poll, while their weaker numbers in Quebec open up a swathe of seats to the Liberals and Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois. But this poll puts the Conservatives in minority territory, which could be enough to end their time in government. The New Democrats and Liberals could combine for 170 seats, just above the half-way mark.<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rRWSTC3jgP4/UFhuwfpZjkI/AAAAAAAAKdo/okKfq0DY0Qg/s1600/Nanos.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"271\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rRWSTC3jgP4/UFhuwfpZjkI/AAAAAAAAKdo/okKfq0DY0Qg/s400/Nanos.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>While the Harris-Decima poll points to a wide Conservative lead, the <a href=\"http://www.nanosresearch.com/library/polls/2012-09-BallotE.pdf\">Nanos poll</a> suggests that the Tories and NDP remain in a neck-and-neck contest.<br /><br />Nanos was last in the field July 7-12, and since then the Conservatives slipped 1.2 points to 32.4% support. The New Democrats were up 0.1 point to 30.4%, while the Liberals were down 1.9 points to 24.6%.<br /><br />That Conservative edge is statistically insignificant, and none of the shifts in support suggest any real movement. Status quo, in other words, rather than the changing landscape of the Harris-Decima poll.<br /><br />No shifts of consequence happened at the regional level, the Conservatives ahead with 35.4% in Ontario (-1.4). They were closely followed by the NDP at 32.6% (+7) and the Liberals with 26.3% (-5). In Quebec, the NDP slipped 5.1 points to 33.7% and were trailed by the Liberals at 24% (-1) and the Bloc at 20.5% (+3.3). And in British Columbia, the Tories had the edge with 34.3% support (-6.1) to 31.1% for the NDP (-3.2) and 21% for the Liberals (+1.5).<br /><br />The only lead of statistical significance in this poll was in the Prairies, which includes Alberta in Nanos&apos;s reckoning. That makes it somewhat more difficult to estimate how to distribute support across the three provinces included in the Prairies.<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3L6XPAjnUvk/UFhvv5BHNnI/AAAAAAAAKdw/E9rRNS0rxsM/s1600/Nanos+Seats.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"198\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3L6XPAjnUvk/UFhvv5BHNnI/AAAAAAAAKdw/E9rRNS0rxsM/s400/Nanos+Seats.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>But with Nanos&apos;s numbers the Conservatives would win 148 seats to 114 for the New Democrats and 72 for the Liberals. The Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois would win only three seats and the Greens just one.<br /><br />The difference maker for the NDP in this poll is Ontario and Quebec. While this poll does not give a lot more support to the NDP in Quebec than Harris-Decima does, the poorer showing for the Bloc leaves a lot of Quebec seats in the NDP&apos;s hands. The Liberals still manage to take a good chunk. Here again, the Conservatives are in minority territory and outnumbered (186) by the NDP and Liberal opposition.<br /><br />Nanos includes personal ratings for all of the leaders, and the numbers were quite good for Stephen Harper. Despite his party slipping marginally nationwide, his own numbers were up by five points to 28% on \"vision for Canada\", six points to 29% on trust, and 10 points to 37% on competence. That gave him an overall score of 93.4 points on Nanos&apos;s Leadership Index (just the sum total of the percentages on the three qualities), a gain of 20.7 points.<br /><br />Thomas Mulcair was up 1.2 points to 48 on the Leadership Index, picking up two points on trust (18%), holding steady on competence (13%), but losing one point on vision (17%).<br /><br />Bob Rae was down 3.4 points on the index to 38.1, and was followed by Elizabeth May at 21.1 (+5.7) and Daniel PaillÃ© at 10.1 (+3.1).<br /><br />PaillÃ©&apos;s numbers in Quebec are problematic for the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois. He trails Harper, Mulcair, and Rae on all three qualities by significant margins. Only 6% of Quebecers consider him the most trustworthy and only 3% think he is the most competent and has the best vision. Mulcair, by contrast, managed 40%, 30%, and 35% on those three factors. What this suggests is that Daniel PaillÃ© is either a complete unknown or a drag on the Bloc&apos;s numbers (considering his low visibility, &apos;unknown&apos; is a safer bet). Gilles Duceppe always did much better in these Nanos polls, and if the Bloc can&apos;t improve its leader&apos;s reputation they will have no chance of growing beyond their current base.<br /><br />These two polls tell different stories. Harris-Decima puts the Conservatives firmly in the driver&apos;s seat, while Nanos shows the same close race between the two main parties. Conservatives can delight in the seven point lead or the improving personal numbers for their leader. New Democrats can point to their continued resilience in Nanos&apos;s poll, while Liberals can rejoice that they are at 24% in Quebec. Even the Bloc can be happy with Harris-Decima&apos;s numbers, and the Greens are looking good with 12%-13% in British Columbia.<br /><br />But other polls haven&apos;t been so positive for the Liberals, or so negative for the New Democrats in Quebec. And while the results of the Harris-Decima and Nanos polls are within each&apos;s margin of error, the two stories they tell cannot both be true. Either the Tories are comfortably leading or they are not. Until other polls emerge to tell us which is the case, partisans of every stripe have something to gloat over.<img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/623376556094758746-7953400191116190525?l=www.threehundredeight.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',1348689584,NULL,NULL,'Ã‰ric','http://www.blogger.com/profile/06849352443716808247','2012-09-18T09:18:00.000-04:00',NULL,'ThreeHundredEight.com',NULL,'To inaugurate a new sitting of Parliament, polls by Nanos Research and Harris-Decima were released to a curious public.

The New Democrats and Liberals could combine for 170 seats, just above the half-way mark.<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rRWSTC3jgP4/UFhuwfpZjkI/AAAAAAAAKdo/okKfq0DY0Qg/s1600/Nanos.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"271\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rRWSTC3jgP4/UFhuwfpZjkI/AAAAAAAAKdo/okKfq0DY0Qg/s400/Nanos.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>While the Harris-Decima poll points to a wide Conservative lead, the <a href=\"http://www.nanosresearch.com/library/polls/2012-09-BallotE.pdf\">Nanos poll</a> suggests that the Tories and NDP remain in a neck-and-neck contest.<br /><br />Nanos was last in the field July 7-12, and since then the Conservatives slipped 1.2 points to 32.4% support. The New Democrats were up 0.1 point to 30.4%, while the Liberals were down 1.9 points to 24.6%.<br /><br />That Conservative edge is statistically insignificant, and none of the shifts in support suggest any real movement. Status quo, in other words, rather than the changing landscape of the Harris-Decima poll.<br /><br />No shifts of consequence happened at the regional level, the Conservatives ahead with 35.4% in Ontario (-1.4). They were closely followed by the NDP at 32.6% (+7) and the Liberals with 26.3% (-5). In Quebec, the NDP slipped 5.1 points to 33.7% and were trailed by the Liberals at 24% (-1) and the Bloc at 20.5% (+3.3). And in British Columbia, the Tories had the edge with 34.3% support (-6.1) to 31.1% for the NDP (-3.2) and 21% for the Liberals (+1.5).<br /><br />The only lead of statistical significance in this poll was in the Prairies, which includes Alberta in Nanos&apos;s reckoning. That makes it somewhat more difficult to estimate how to distribute support across the three provinces included in the Prairies.<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3L6XPAjnUvk/UFhvv5BHNnI/AAAAAAAAKdw/E9rRNS0rxsM/s1600/Nanos+Seats.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"198\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3L6XPAjnUvk/UFhvv5BHNnI/AAAAAAAAKdw/E9rRNS0rxsM/s400/Nanos+Seats.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>But with Nanos&apos;s numbers the Conservatives would win 148 seats to 114 for the New Democrats and 72 for the Liberals. The Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois would win only three seats and the Greens just one.<br /><br />The difference maker for the NDP in this poll is Ontario and Quebec. While this poll does not give a lot more support to the NDP in Quebec than Harris-Decima does, the poorer showing for the Bloc leaves a lot of Quebec seats in the NDP&apos;s hands. The Liberals still manage to take a good chunk. Here again, the Conservatives are in minority territory and outnumbered (186) by the NDP and Liberal opposition.<br /><br />Nanos includes personal ratings for all of the leaders, and the numbers were quite good for Stephen Harper. Despite his party slipping marginally nationwide, his own numbers were up by five points to 28% on \"vision for Canada\", six points to 29% on trust, and 10 points to 37% on competence. That gave him an overall score of 93.4 points on Nanos&apos;s Leadership Index (just the sum total of the percentages on the three qualities), a gain of 20.7 points.<br /><br />Thomas Mulcair was up 1.2 points to 48 on the Leadership Index, picking up two points on trust (18%), holding steady on competence (13%), but losing one point on vision (17%).<br /><br />Bob Rae was down 3.4 points on the index to 38.1, and was followed by Elizabeth May at 21.1 (+5.7) and Daniel PaillÃ© at 10.1 (+3.1).<br /><br />PaillÃ©&apos;s numbers in Quebec are problematic for the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois. He trails Harper, Mulcair, and Rae on all three qualities by significant margins. Only 6% of Quebecers consider him the most trustworthy and only 3% think he is the most competent and has the best vision. Mulcair, by contrast, managed 40%, 30%, and 35% on those three factors. What this suggests is that Daniel PaillÃ© is either a complete unknown or a drag on the Bloc&apos;s numbers (considering his low visibility, &apos;unknown&apos; is a safer bet). Gilles Duceppe always did much better in these Nanos polls, and if the Bloc can&apos;t improve its leader&apos;s reputation they will have no chance of growing beyond their current base.<br /><br />These two polls tell different stories. Harris-Decima puts the Conservatives firmly in the driver&apos;s seat, while Nanos shows the same close race between the two main parties. Conservatives can delight in the seven point lead or the improving personal numbers for their leader. New Democrats can point to their continued resilience in Nanos&apos;s poll, while Liberals can rejoice that they are at 24% in Quebec. Even the Bloc can be happy with Harris-Decima&apos;s numbers, and the Greens are looking good with 12%-13% in British Columbia.<br /><br />But other polls haven&apos;t been so positive for the Liberals, or so negative for the New Democrats in Quebec. And while the results of the Harris-Decima and Nanos polls are within each&apos;s margin of error, the two stories they tell cannot both be true. Either the Tories are comfortably leading or they are not. Until other polls emerge to tell us which is the case, partisans of every stripe have something to gloat over.<img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/623376556094758746-7953400191116190525?l=www.threehundredeight.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'News','News',NULL),(83,0,0,'B.C.

That is a rather wide spread, with Angus-Reid finding the disapproval rating being higher. The source appears to be those who are not sure - they represent 29% of the population according to Forum but only 16% according to Angus-Reid.

But the surprise was not in the grand strokes of the outcome itself: as expected, the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois won with the Liberals forming the Official Opposition, the Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec coming third, and QuÃ©bec Solidaire winning two seats. The surprise instead came in the details.<br /><br />A minority result for the PQ was always a distinct possibility, but it turned out to be a lot smaller than expected. The Liberals were best positioned to finish second, but they out-performed expectations to a significant degree.

The problem with the projection was that the Liberals were under-estimated in the polls, which meant that the projected results over-estimated both the PQ and the CAQ.<br /><br />The Quebec election was not a repeat of the Alberta election. Equating the two would be a silly mistake. The polls in Quebec were generally within the margin of error for the PQ, CAQ, and QS and they only under-estimated the Liberals. The polls from the Alberta election gave Wildrose a 10-point lead when the result was a 10-point win for the Progressive Conservatives. Nothing close to that occurred last Tuesday.<br /><br />In terms of the Alberta election, the question of \"what went wrong?\" can certainly be asked. The public polls did not capture a swing in the last week that internal polls did manage to identify. The question that should be asked in Quebec is \"why were the results different?\"<br /><br />Polls are often erroneously seen as simply a way to predict an outcome. They are, of course, a snapshot and things can change - but voting intentions rarely shift to a significant degree in a matter of days. That is why results usually match the last polls of a campaign. But polls are most useful as a way to understand and contextualize what is going on during an election campaign. After the election is over, they can be a very good tool to understand what happened. And projections based on polling data do the same.<br /><br />Of course, polls and projections will always have a degree of error and I will take a look at the errors the projection made below. But working from the idea (which has been proven over time, notwithstanding the few exceptions) that in a normal election polls can track the voting intentions of the population accurately and that projections can turn those numbers into accurate seat counts, a comparison of polls/projections to results paints a very good picture, not of how polls and projections failed, but of what worked and what didn&apos;t <i>for the parties themselves</i>.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0H5d88w_2pU/UE4IRVEBBCI/AAAAAAAAKVw/-fPQ9Ih8yNQ/s1600/PM+2.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0H5d88w_2pU/UE4IRVEBBCI/AAAAAAAAKVw/-fPQ9Ih8yNQ/s400/PM+2.PNG\" width=\"141\" /></a>For a full statistical breakdown of the projection&apos;s performance, I invite you to take a look at the <a href=\"http://www.threehundredeight.com/2011/05/threehundredeights-track-record.html\">Electoral Track Record</a>.<br /><br />How would the seat projection model have worked had the polls been bang-on in each of the model&apos;s six regions? Polls for three of them (Montreal island, Montreal suburbs, and Quebec City) were available throughout the campaign while polls for the other three (Eastern, Central, and Western Quebec) were available for some of the polls.<br /><br />The model would have awarded the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois 53 seats, the Liberals 42, the CAQ 28, and two to QuÃ©bec Solidaire. In other words, a strong result for the PQ and QS and an under-estimation of Liberal strength to the benefit of the CAQ.<br /><br />The riding accuracy, at 81.6%, would not have changed but the potential winners would have been identified in 94.4% of ridings when using the seat projection ranges.<br /><br />Those ranges (using the polling volatility in the last week of the campaign as a guide, as the model normally does) would have encompassed the final result: 41-65 for the PQ, 34-55 for the Liberals, 18-38 for the CAQ, and 1-2 for QS. The projection would have called for a PQ minority, a strong Liberal opposition, and a third place finish for the CAQ, while the odds would have been considered very unlikely for a PQ majority or a CAQ second-place finish. This would have been a good call.<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yMOdnKEzHJg/UE4IQeTozEI/AAAAAAAAKVo/Zs13OsMz048/s1600/PM+1.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"195\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yMOdnKEzHJg/UE4IQeTozEI/AAAAAAAAKVo/Zs13OsMz048/s400/PM+1.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>So the projection model would have been able to forecast the election properly with accurate polling - but nevertheless the most likely outcome would have still under-estimated the Liberals to a significant degree. Why?<br /><br />This is where the results of the election and how they differ from polls and projections can tell us something about what went right for the Liberal campaign. In the Alberta election, to take one example, the projection model would have done very well with accurate polls with one exception - the extraordinary resilience of Liberal incumbents in Edmonton and (especially) Calgary. With the Liberal vote dropping so steeply in Alberta as a whole, no projection model that wasn&apos;t based on a hunch could have forecast that the Liberal incumbents in these two cities would prove so difficult to topple. While that was an example of the projection model being wrong, it said more about the Liberals in those ridings than it did about the model itself.<br /><br /><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eEiREq12TSg/UE4K-fAcWQI/AAAAAAAAKWI/kYZkeny-cAc/s1600/PM+3.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eEiREq12TSg/UE4K-fAcWQI/AAAAAAAAKWI/kYZkeny-cAc/s200/PM+3.PNG\" width=\"198\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Region vote projections vs. results</td></tr></tbody></table>The chart to the left shows the difference between the projection and the results in each of the six regions. We can see that the Liberals did significantly better than expected in Montreal (though it did them no good in terms of seats), in Quebec City, and central Quebec.<br /><br />The performance of the Liberals in central Quebec was quite remarkable. Polling data that was available for the region in the mid-point of the campaign, when the Liberals were far from out of the race, showed that central Quebec was not a strong part of the province for the party. It put them at 27%, behind the PQ and the CAQ. As their vote tanked in the polls in the regions of Quebec and among francophones (not to mention the riding polls that showed the Liberals with little support in Nicolet-BÃ©cancour, Saint-FranÃ§ois, Saint-Maurice, Sherbrooke, and Trois-RiviÃ¨res), the projection put the Liberals at between 23% and 29% in the region. They ended up with 32.2% of the vote, beating out the CAQ (30.9%) and the PQ (28.4%).<br /><br />As a result, this was the region with the most amount of errors and the region that skewed the projection against the Liberals most importantly. Their vote in this highly francophone region turned out in great numbers, voting for their incumbent MNAs in particular. Along with a surprising degree of resilience in the Montreal suburbs, particularly Laval, this was the region of Quebec that &apos;saved&apos; the Liberals from a far more significant defeat.<br /><br /><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AwtS6L5soAs/UE4NNVcHUvI/AAAAAAAAKWQ/Kdr5jvHrGGg/s1600/PM+4.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AwtS6L5soAs/UE4NNVcHUvI/AAAAAAAAKWQ/Kdr5jvHrGGg/s320/PM+4.PNG\" width=\"174\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Seat projections vs. results</td></tr></tbody></table>But what happened to the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois? They were over-estimated almost across the board, with eastern Quebec being the only region where they out-performed expectations. The seat ranges were only off by three seats for the PQ, however, and that can mostly be attributed to the strong Liberal performance in central Quebec. But it can also be blamed on the PQ&apos;s under-achieving results in the suburbs around Montreal.<br /><br />The PQ was projected to take between 38% and 42% of the vote in this region, but ended up with 35.9%. Neither the Liberals nor the CAQ were outside of their projected ranges in the suburbs, but both were at the higher end of expectations. The 450 was considered the make-or-break region for both the PQ and the CAQ, and in the end this was correct. The PQ won 15 seats instead of the projected 19, putting them at the very bottom of their expected results. They could have won as many as 24 seats in the region, enough alone to have given them a majority government.<br /><br />For the CAQ, they did as well as expected in and around Montreal and Quebec City. The projection gave them seven seats in Quebec City, which they indeed won, and seven in the suburbs. They took six.<br /><br />But it was in francophone Quebec outside of the two main centres where the CAQ vote did not materialize. The party won no seats in eastern Quebec instead of the projected one, one seat in western Quebec instead of the projected three, and five seats in central Quebec instead of the projected nine. But, generally speaking, the projection was quite good in estimating the CAQ&apos;s vote - and the projection model would have still given them nine more seats than they actually won if the polls had been completely accurate.<br /><br />Why? The CAQ&apos;s under-performance is one case where the error that the projection made tells us something important about the CAQ. The CAQ&apos;s vote share aligned quite closely with the polls and the projection, but their seat result did not.<br /><br />The reason for this is that the CAQ&apos;s vote was far more uniform than the ADQ&apos;s. If the ADQ had gotten 27.1% of the vote in this election, they very likely would have won around 28 seats. But despite the CAQ having swallowed up the ADQ and its MNAs, the party is not the same. It does use the same populist and vaguely nationalist language of Mario Dumont, but the party and its leader take a more centrist approach. That changed the party&apos;s voter profile somewhat, enough to give the CAQ relatively even support - particularly in central and western Quebec. The model expected the CAQ&apos;s vote to be more heavily concentrated in central Quebec to the detriment of the western part of the province - instead, the CAQ&apos;s vote was more uniform and that meant a lot of second place finishes.<br /><br />When the next election occurs, which considering the minority government in place could not be very long, the model will undoubtedly perform better because it will be able to use the CAQ&apos;s vote as a baseline, rather than the ADQ&apos;s.<br /><br />Another factor which made the projection over-estimate the CAQ was the adjustment made for the floor-crossers in Blainville, Deux-Montagnes, and Sanguinet. While the adjustment would have worked in most elections, for whatever reason it did not work in this one. It over-estimated the support of Daniel RatthÃ©, Benoit Charette, and FranÃ§ois Rebello to a significant degree. Without the adjustment in place, the model would have correctly given Blainville to RatthÃ© but Deux-Montagnes and Sanguinet to the PQ. The results for each party would have been quite accurate - indicating that the floor-crossers did not personally bring any large number of &amp;nbsp;votes with them.<br /><br />If we look closely at the results, the projection did well on some of the minor details. QuÃ©bec Solidaire&apos;s results were projected very well, with the result of 12% on the island of Montreal (their most important region) being off of the projection by 0.1 point. The model also did quite well with Option Nationale, the Greens, and the other parties.<br /><br />The projected ranges were correct for every party in some tough-to-call ridings as well: Jean-Lesage (correctly forecasting a close three-way race), Groulx, and Gouin, among others. Generally speaking, the model did quite well on an individual basis for each party in the ridings where the winner was called correctly. The ridings that were not called correctly often had very large errors, suggesting that fiercely local circumstances were at play in many of them.<br /><br />But the turnout adjustments may not have helped matters. While it did correctly assume that QS would be over-estimated and the PLQ under-estimated, and the adjustment did not effect the projection for the CAQ significantly, it was wrong to consider the PQ under-estimated in the polls. The last surveys by CROP and LÃ©ger were excellent for the PQ, and the last surveys by Forum and EKOS over-estimated the PQ greatly.<br /><br />The model made a bet that, in most elections, would have been correct. Going forward, I am not sure if this is a bet that is worthwhile to make. The adjustment seems to have caused a lot of confusion during the campaign, with readers not understanding why I had the CAQ so low and the PQ and PLQ so high, no matter how many times I explained it. Perhaps it would be best for ThreeHundredEight to limit itself to poll aggregation and what those polls would deliver in terms of seats, with the high and low ranges being used to estimate how the polls are expected to be wrong. I welcome suggestions from readers.<br /><br />With the surprising performance of Jean Charest&apos;s Liberals, the Quebec election threw almost everyone for a loop. But the results might have had more to do with the Liberals&apos; stronger organization and the mythical <i>prime Ã  l&apos;urne </i>playing a role than the errors of polls and projectors. Quebec&apos;s distinct society does seem to come with distinct elections - no one will be surprised if next time the result is, well, a surprise.<br /><img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/623376556094758746-3374238459394051075?l=www.threehundredeight.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',1348689587,NULL,NULL,'Ã‰ric','http://www.blogger.com/profile/06849352443716808247','2012-09-10T12:35:00.001-04:00',NULL,'ThreeHundredEight.com',NULL,'Less than a week ago, the results of the Quebec election came as a bit of a surprise to pollsters and pundits.

But working from the idea (which has been proven over time, notwithstanding the few exceptions) that in a normal election polls can track the voting intentions of the population accurately and that projections can turn those numbers into accurate seat counts, a comparison of polls/projections to results paints a very good picture, not of how polls and projections failed, but of what worked and what didn&apos;t <i>for the parties themselves</i>.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0H5d88w_2pU/UE4IRVEBBCI/AAAAAAAAKVw/-fPQ9Ih8yNQ/s1600/PM+2.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0H5d88w_2pU/UE4IRVEBBCI/AAAAAAAAKVw/-fPQ9Ih8yNQ/s400/PM+2.PNG\" width=\"141\" /></a>For a full statistical breakdown of the projection&apos;s performance, I invite you to take a look at the <a href=\"http://www.threehundredeight.com/2011/05/threehundredeights-track-record.html\">Electoral Track Record</a>.<br /><br />How would the seat projection model have worked had the polls been bang-on in each of the model&apos;s six regions? Polls for three of them (Montreal island, Montreal suburbs, and Quebec City) were available throughout the campaign while polls for the other three (Eastern, Central, and Western Quebec) were available for some of the polls.<br /><br />The model would have awarded the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois 53 seats, the Liberals 42, the CAQ 28, and two to QuÃ©bec Solidaire. In other words, a strong result for the PQ and QS and an under-estimation of Liberal strength to the benefit of the CAQ.<br /><br />The riding accuracy, at 81.6%, would not have changed but the potential winners would have been identified in 94.4% of ridings when using the seat projection ranges.<br /><br />Those ranges (using the polling volatility in the last week of the campaign as a guide, as the model normally does) would have encompassed the final result: 41-65 for the PQ, 34-55 for the Liberals, 18-38 for the CAQ, and 1-2 for QS. The projection would have called for a PQ minority, a strong Liberal opposition, and a third place finish for the CAQ, while the odds would have been considered very unlikely for a PQ majority or a CAQ second-place finish. This would have been a good call.<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yMOdnKEzHJg/UE4IQeTozEI/AAAAAAAAKVo/Zs13OsMz048/s1600/PM+1.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"195\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yMOdnKEzHJg/UE4IQeTozEI/AAAAAAAAKVo/Zs13OsMz048/s400/PM+1.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>So the projection model would have been able to forecast the election properly with accurate polling - but nevertheless the most likely outcome would have still under-estimated the Liberals to a significant degree. Why?<br /><br />This is where the results of the election and how they differ from polls and projections can tell us something about what went right for the Liberal campaign. In the Alberta election, to take one example, the projection model would have done very well with accurate polls with one exception - the extraordinary resilience of Liberal incumbents in Edmonton and (especially) Calgary. With the Liberal vote dropping so steeply in Alberta as a whole, no projection model that wasn&apos;t based on a hunch could have forecast that the Liberal incumbents in these two cities would prove so difficult to topple. While that was an example of the projection model being wrong, it said more about the Liberals in those ridings than it did about the model itself.<br /><br /><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eEiREq12TSg/UE4K-fAcWQI/AAAAAAAAKWI/kYZkeny-cAc/s1600/PM+3.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eEiREq12TSg/UE4K-fAcWQI/AAAAAAAAKWI/kYZkeny-cAc/s200/PM+3.PNG\" width=\"198\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Region vote projections vs. results</td></tr></tbody></table>The chart to the left shows the difference between the projection and the results in each of the six regions. We can see that the Liberals did significantly better than expected in Montreal (though it did them no good in terms of seats), in Quebec City, and central Quebec.<br /><br />The performance of the Liberals in central Quebec was quite remarkable. Polling data that was available for the region in the mid-point of the campaign, when the Liberals were far from out of the race, showed that central Quebec was not a strong part of the province for the party. It put them at 27%, behind the PQ and the CAQ. As their vote tanked in the polls in the regions of Quebec and among francophones (not to mention the riding polls that showed the Liberals with little support in Nicolet-BÃ©cancour, Saint-FranÃ§ois, Saint-Maurice, Sherbrooke, and Trois-RiviÃ¨res), the projection put the Liberals at between 23% and 29% in the region. They ended up with 32.2% of the vote, beating out the CAQ (30.9%) and the PQ (28.4%).<br /><br />As a result, this was the region with the most amount of errors and the region that skewed the projection against the Liberals most importantly. Their vote in this highly francophone region turned out in great numbers, voting for their incumbent MNAs in particular. Along with a surprising degree of resilience in the Montreal suburbs, particularly Laval, this was the region of Quebec that &apos;saved&apos; the Liberals from a far more significant defeat.<br /><br /><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AwtS6L5soAs/UE4NNVcHUvI/AAAAAAAAKWQ/Kdr5jvHrGGg/s1600/PM+4.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AwtS6L5soAs/UE4NNVcHUvI/AAAAAAAAKWQ/Kdr5jvHrGGg/s320/PM+4.PNG\" width=\"174\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Seat projections vs. results</td></tr></tbody></table>But what happened to the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois? They were over-estimated almost across the board, with eastern Quebec being the only region where they out-performed expectations. The seat ranges were only off by three seats for the PQ, however, and that can mostly be attributed to the strong Liberal performance in central Quebec. But it can also be blamed on the PQ&apos;s under-achieving results in the suburbs around Montreal.<br /><br />The PQ was projected to take between 38% and 42% of the vote in this region, but ended up with 35.9%. Neither the Liberals nor the CAQ were outside of their projected ranges in the suburbs, but both were at the higher end of expectations. The 450 was considered the make-or-break region for both the PQ and the CAQ, and in the end this was correct. The PQ won 15 seats instead of the projected 19, putting them at the very bottom of their expected results. They could have won as many as 24 seats in the region, enough alone to have given them a majority government.<br /><br />For the CAQ, they did as well as expected in and around Montreal and Quebec City. The projection gave them seven seats in Quebec City, which they indeed won, and seven in the suburbs. They took six.<br /><br />But it was in francophone Quebec outside of the two main centres where the CAQ vote did not materialize. The party won no seats in eastern Quebec instead of the projected one, one seat in western Quebec instead of the projected three, and five seats in central Quebec instead of the projected nine. But, generally speaking, the projection was quite good in estimating the CAQ&apos;s vote - and the projection model would have still given them nine more seats than they actually won if the polls had been completely accurate.<br /><br />Why? The CAQ&apos;s under-performance is one case where the error that the projection made tells us something important about the CAQ. The CAQ&apos;s vote share aligned quite closely with the polls and the projection, but their seat result did not.<br /><br />The reason for this is that the CAQ&apos;s vote was far more uniform than the ADQ&apos;s. If the ADQ had gotten 27.1% of the vote in this election, they very likely would have won around 28 seats. But despite the CAQ having swallowed up the ADQ and its MNAs, the party is not the same. It does use the same populist and vaguely nationalist language of Mario Dumont, but the party and its leader take a more centrist approach. That changed the party&apos;s voter profile somewhat, enough to give the CAQ relatively even support - particularly in central and western Quebec. The model expected the CAQ&apos;s vote to be more heavily concentrated in central Quebec to the detriment of the western part of the province - instead, the CAQ&apos;s vote was more uniform and that meant a lot of second place finishes.<br /><br />When the next election occurs, which considering the minority government in place could not be very long, the model will undoubtedly perform better because it will be able to use the CAQ&apos;s vote as a baseline, rather than the ADQ&apos;s.<br /><br />Another factor which made the projection over-estimate the CAQ was the adjustment made for the floor-crossers in Blainville, Deux-Montagnes, and Sanguinet. While the adjustment would have worked in most elections, for whatever reason it did not work in this one. It over-estimated the support of Daniel RatthÃ©, Benoit Charette, and FranÃ§ois Rebello to a significant degree. Without the adjustment in place, the model would have correctly given Blainville to RatthÃ© but Deux-Montagnes and Sanguinet to the PQ. The results for each party would have been quite accurate - indicating that the floor-crossers did not personally bring any large number of &amp;nbsp;votes with them.<br /><br />If we look closely at the results, the projection did well on some of the minor details. QuÃ©bec Solidaire&apos;s results were projected very well, with the result of 12% on the island of Montreal (their most important region) being off of the projection by 0.1 point. The model also did quite well with Option Nationale, the Greens, and the other parties.<br /><br />The projected ranges were correct for every party in some tough-to-call ridings as well: Jean-Lesage (correctly forecasting a close three-way race), Groulx, and Gouin, among others. Generally speaking, the model did quite well on an individual basis for each party in the ridings where the winner was called correctly. The ridings that were not called correctly often had very large errors, suggesting that fiercely local circumstances were at play in many of them.<br /><br />But the turnout adjustments may not have helped matters. While it did correctly assume that QS would be over-estimated and the PLQ under-estimated, and the adjustment did not effect the projection for the CAQ significantly, it was wrong to consider the PQ under-estimated in the polls. The last surveys by CROP and LÃ©ger were excellent for the PQ, and the last surveys by Forum and EKOS over-estimated the PQ greatly.<br /><br />The model made a bet that, in most elections, would have been correct. Going forward, I am not sure if this is a bet that is worthwhile to make. The adjustment seems to have caused a lot of confusion during the campaign, with readers not understanding why I had the CAQ so low and the PQ and PLQ so high, no matter how many times I explained it. Perhaps it would be best for ThreeHundredEight to limit itself to poll aggregation and what those polls would deliver in terms of seats, with the high and low ranges being used to estimate how the polls are expected to be wrong. I welcome suggestions from readers.<br /><br />With the surprising performance of Jean Charest&apos;s Liberals, the Quebec election threw almost everyone for a loop. But the results might have had more to do with the Liberals&apos; stronger organization and the mythical <i>prime Ã  l&apos;urne </i>playing a role than the errors of polls and projectors. Quebec&apos;s distinct society does seem to come with distinct elections - no one will be surprised if next time the result is, well, a surprise.<br /><img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/623376556094758746-3374238459394051075?l=www.threehundredeight.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'News','News',NULL),(87,0,0,'NDP wins KitWat, Liberals hold Vaughan','text/html','http://www.threehundredeight.com/2012/09/ndp-wins-kitwat-liberals-hold-vaughan.html','By-elections;Canada',NULL,NULL,2,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-07 09:13:42',6,'Dalton McGuinty was not given a majority government last night and Andrea Horwath&apos;s NDP made a big breakthrough in Kitchener-Waterloo, as some 80,000 Ontarians voted in two provincial by-elections.<br /><br />The result in Kitchener-Waterloo was the most anticipated, as a win by the Liberals would have awarded McGuinty enough seats to ensure his government&apos;s survival.

The Liberals have a very good chance at winning one of the two by-elections, but the other is truly too close to call.<br /><br />That by-election is the one in Kitchener-Waterloo. Formerly a safe Progressive Conservative seat under Elizabeth Witmer, Kitchener-Waterloo has transformed into a three-way race where each of the major parties has led in a poll.<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BonBCENxirk/UEibfojA9UI/AAAAAAAAKTU/5FsqJ0K54vE/s1600/Kitchener-Waterloo.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"318\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BonBCENxirk/UEibfojA9UI/AAAAAAAAKTU/5FsqJ0K54vE/s400/Kitchener-Waterloo.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>The fundamentals of Kitchener-Waterloo make this riding one that the Progressive Conservatives should win. Witmer won it by respectable margins in 2007 and 2011, and the provincial trends suggest that the Tories should have no problem holding the riding. The party is either steady or up in the polls while the Liberals are down.<br /><br />But Tracey Weiler will have a tough fight on her hands. The first poll by Forum Research shortly after Witmer&apos;s resignation gave the Liberals a seven-point lead. A few months later, Forum gave Weiler a four-point lead and suggested that the New Democrats were making gains. Their last poll, taken only two days ago, put Catherine Fife of the NDP ahead by 16 points!<br /><br />That doesn&apos;t mean Liberal candidate Eric Davis is out of the running. Another poll, this time by Oracle, taken at the end of August put the Liberals and Tories in a tie, with the NDP only four points behind.<br /><br />Taking the fundamentals of the riding into consideration as well as the riding specific polling, ThreeHundredEight can only forecast that this riding is a toss-up between the Progressive Conservatives (25% to 46%), the Liberals (25% to 38%), and the New Democrats (14% to 39%).<br /><br />The winner in Kitchener-Waterloo will be the party that gets its voters to the polls. But with the high stakes, this should be a high turnout by-election. Will voters go with the party they have in the past? Will they give McGuinty a majority? Or will they try out the NDP?<br /><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-f8Qjt9D4GL4/UEidBUtz5PI/AAAAAAAAKTc/cPEHQZnuDCE/s1600/Vaughan.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"301\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-f8Qjt9D4GL4/UEidBUtz5PI/AAAAAAAAKTc/cPEHQZnuDCE/s400/Vaughan.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>The by-election in Vaughan is much more clear cut. The Liberals have dominated in this riding, winning by more than 40 points in 2007 and 20 points last year. The fundamentals give the Liberals the edge despite their sagging poll numbers, and polls done specifically for the riding have given Liberal candidate Steven Del Duca a double-digit lead over the Tories&apos; Tony Genco. A poll done in early August did give the PCs a one-point advantage, but this was before the candidates for the riding were nominated.<br /><br />This makes Vaughan a Strong Liberal riding, and one that the Liberals should hold. But Vaughan can swing - it went over to the federal Conservatives in 2010 in a close by-election and then voted strongly for Julian Fantino in 2011. So an upset could always happen, but Vaughan should stay Liberal. The forecast is for the party to take between 40% and 58% of the vote, with the Tories taking between 28% and 39% and the New Democrats between 9% and 15%.<br /><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Vy-B39m1308/UEif_FsSCTI/AAAAAAAAKT8/7e5GSiwWHcI/s1600/Fort+Whyte.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"278\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Vy-B39m1308/UEif_FsSCTI/AAAAAAAAKT8/7e5GSiwWHcI/s400/Fort+Whyte.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>Lost in the hubbub over the Quebec election on Tuesday was a by-election in Manitoba, where Brian Pallister (newly minted leader of the Progressive Conservatives) was making his attempt to enter the Manitoba legislature in place of former leader Hugh McFadyen.<br /><br />As expected, Palliser easily won the by-election in Fort Whyte with 55.2% of the vote, a small drop of seven points from the 2012 election. He won by 23.6 points, virtually identical to the average margin of 24 points expected by the forecast model.<br /><br />What was unexpected was the strong performance of the Liberals. Bob Axworthy was a decent candidate for the Liberals and put up a hard fight, while the governing New Democrats held back. As a result, the Liberals made a gain of 23.7 points and finished with 31.6%, a great result for a party that had 7.5% support province-wide in the last election (and 7.9% in Fort Whyte).

Dalton McGuinty&apos;s Liberals can cobble together a pseudo-majority government if they win both, and it would go a long way towards ensuring the survival of the Ontario government until the end of McGuinty&apos;s four-year mandate. The Liberals have a very good chance at winning one of the two by-elections, but the other is truly too close to call.<br /><br />That by-election is the one in Kitchener-Waterloo. Formerly a safe Progressive Conservative seat under Elizabeth Witmer, Kitchener-Waterloo has transformed into a three-way race where each of the major parties has led in a poll.<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BonBCENxirk/UEibfojA9UI/AAAAAAAAKTU/5FsqJ0K54vE/s1600/Kitchener-Waterloo.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"318\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BonBCENxirk/UEibfojA9UI/AAAAAAAAKTU/5FsqJ0K54vE/s400/Kitchener-Waterloo.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>The fundamentals of Kitchener-Waterloo make this riding one that the Progressive Conservatives should win. Witmer won it by respectable margins in 2007 and 2011, and the provincial trends suggest that the Tories should have no problem holding the riding. The party is either steady or up in the polls while the Liberals are down.<br /><br />But Tracey Weiler will have a tough fight on her hands. The first poll by Forum Research shortly after Witmer&apos;s resignation gave the Liberals a seven-point lead. A few months later, Forum gave Weiler a four-point lead and suggested that the New Democrats were making gains. Their last poll, taken only two days ago, put Catherine Fife of the NDP ahead by 16 points!<br /><br />That doesn&apos;t mean Liberal candidate Eric Davis is out of the running. Another poll, this time by Oracle, taken at the end of August put the Liberals and Tories in a tie, with the NDP only four points behind.<br /><br />Taking the fundamentals of the riding into consideration as well as the riding specific polling, ThreeHundredEight can only forecast that this riding is a toss-up between the Progressive Conservatives (25% to 46%), the Liberals (25% to 38%), and the New Democrats (14% to 39%).<br /><br />The winner in Kitchener-Waterloo will be the party that gets its voters to the polls. But with the high stakes, this should be a high turnout by-election. Will voters go with the party they have in the past? Will they give McGuinty a majority? Or will they try out the NDP?<br /><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-f8Qjt9D4GL4/UEidBUtz5PI/AAAAAAAAKTc/cPEHQZnuDCE/s1600/Vaughan.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"301\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-f8Qjt9D4GL4/UEidBUtz5PI/AAAAAAAAKTc/cPEHQZnuDCE/s400/Vaughan.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>The by-election in Vaughan is much more clear cut. The Liberals have dominated in this riding, winning by more than 40 points in 2007 and 20 points last year. The fundamentals give the Liberals the edge despite their sagging poll numbers, and polls done specifically for the riding have given Liberal candidate Steven Del Duca a double-digit lead over the Tories&apos; Tony Genco. A poll done in early August did give the PCs a one-point advantage, but this was before the candidates for the riding were nominated.<br /><br />This makes Vaughan a Strong Liberal riding, and one that the Liberals should hold. But Vaughan can swing - it went over to the federal Conservatives in 2010 in a close by-election and then voted strongly for Julian Fantino in 2011. So an upset could always happen, but Vaughan should stay Liberal. The forecast is for the party to take between 40% and 58% of the vote, with the Tories taking between 28% and 39% and the New Democrats between 9% and 15%.<br /><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Vy-B39m1308/UEif_FsSCTI/AAAAAAAAKT8/7e5GSiwWHcI/s1600/Fort+Whyte.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"278\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Vy-B39m1308/UEif_FsSCTI/AAAAAAAAKT8/7e5GSiwWHcI/s400/Fort+Whyte.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>Lost in the hubbub over the Quebec election on Tuesday was a by-election in Manitoba, where Brian Pallister (newly minted leader of the Progressive Conservatives) was making his attempt to enter the Manitoba legislature in place of former leader Hugh McFadyen.<br /><br />As expected, Palliser easily won the by-election in Fort Whyte with 55.2% of the vote, a small drop of seven points from the 2012 election. He won by 23.6 points, virtually identical to the average margin of 24 points expected by the forecast model.<br /><br />What was unexpected was the strong performance of the Liberals. Bob Axworthy was a decent candidate for the Liberals and put up a hard fight, while the governing New Democrats held back. As a result, the Liberals made a gain of 23.7 points and finished with 31.6%, a great result for a party that had 7.5% support province-wide in the last election (and 7.9% in Fort Whyte). The New Democrats accordingly dropped 18.4 points to only 11.4%, but considering the circumstances I would not take this as a knock against the government.<br /><br />What the results do show is that the Liberals are not quite dead yet.

It is more likely that the Liberals will be given the job, but the CAQ is also capable of jumping from third to second spot in Quebec City.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--qMiz_-wl1Y/UES2yFHpOXI/AAAAAAAAKP0/RYDUSJG71rM/s1600/Post.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--qMiz_-wl1Y/UES2yFHpOXI/AAAAAAAAKP0/RYDUSJG71rM/s320/Post.PNG\" width=\"159\" /></a>With 34.1% support, the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois is projected to win 63 seats tomorrow night. That is the bare minimum for a majority government. The Liberals, with 27.9% support, are projected to win 33 seats. That narrowly edges out the CAQ, who are projected to take 26.3% of the vote and 27 seats.<br /><br />The PQ&apos;s wobbly majority (if the Speaker is from the party, the Assembly would be split straight down the middle) is likely to get some support from QuÃ©bec Solidaire. The party is projected to win 7.1% of the vote and two seats.<br /><br />Option Nationale is projected to take 2.5% of the vote, while the Green Party of Quebec and other parties are expected to get 1% of the vote each.<br /><br />This campaign has shown a remarkable amount of stability for all of the noise that has come out of the province. Since the campaign began, neither CROP nor LÃ©ger Marketing have pegged PQ support at anything other than 32%, 33%, or 34% support, with no discernible change in support since the beginning of the campaign. The Liberals have dropped from around 30% to around 27%, but aside from the Forum poll the Liberals have been steady since before the series of four debates. The CAQ has also been very steady in the last bit of the campaign. They did experience a bump from the early days, but it was only an increase of a handful of points (LÃ©ger had them at 28% in their final poll of the campaign and at 27% in their poll from Aug. 6-8).<br /><br />This leads me to believe that we should not expect any sort of late swing over the final four unpolled days of the campaign (Sept. 1 to 4). If things weren&apos;t moving with a debate and the myriad of rather intense stories over the course of the election, why would they suddenly swing in this last stage?<br /><br /><i><b>UPDATE (Sept. 4, 2012): </b>As they did at the end of the Alberta provincial campaign, Forum Research conducted a poll last night. They <a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/09/03/pq-headed-to-comfortable-majority-final-poll-before-quebec-election/\">released it through </a></i><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/09/03/pq-headed-to-comfortable-majority-final-poll-before-quebec-election/\">The National Post</a><i>. Frank Graves from EKOS Research also published the results of their own polling on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VoiceOfFranky/status/242770964516057089\">his Twitter feed</a>&amp;nbsp;before midnight.</i><br /><i><br /></i> <i>I will not be updating the projection to include this new information (it would be impossible to include EKOS&apos;s numbers as they only reported the topline results). Federal electoral law and the law in many provinces prohibits the publishing of new public opinion polls on Election Day. Whether projections would also be prohibited could potentially be up to the interpretation of a judge. But in addition to not wanting to run that risk, I believe ThreeHundredEight should try to follow the spirit of the law and not publish new projections on Election Day.</i><br /><i><br /></i> <i>The Forum poll, in any case, backs up the final projection. Like the projection, Forum says that LÃ©ger and CROP have under-estimated the PQ and the Liberals and have over-estimated the CAQ and QS. If Forum has it, then the PQ will win a majority government and almost certainly a number of seats within the projection&apos;s upper range for the party. Similarly, the Liberals will become the Official Opposition and the CAQ the third party. I am confident that the projected seat ranges will hold true when the ballots are counted tonight.</i><br /><i><br /></i> <i>EKOS&apos;s poll is another kettle of fish. While they have identical numbers for the PQ and the CAQ as does Forum Research, they have the Liberals at 23% instead of 29% and QS at 11% instead of 6%. That is a very important difference. Granted, EKOS published these numbers as part of a longer poll and as a means of calibrating their surveying model. But the firm can&apos;t put money in the pile and expect to get it back if their bet loses. Forum and EKOS are going for the glory, while LÃ©ger and CROP are safely ensconced in virtually identical numbers a few days back from the vote. It will be interesting to see who will turn out to be right. And in the post-mortem, I will post what the projection would have shown had I included the numbers from Forum and EKOS.</i><br /><i><br /></i> Perhaps the long weekend, one of those mythical opportunities for families and friends to discuss politics and make a collective decision, will play a role in tomorrow night&apos;s vote. But there is nothing to suggest that we should expect a wholesale swing from one party to another. The number of undecideds is not unusually high and though the CAQ&apos;s supporters seem the softest, this comes as no surprise considering they are a &apos;new&apos; party.<br /><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wYa9BMaoNPQ/UES4z4ODaYI/AAAAAAAAKP8/bAZzpPepDoo/s1600/Post+Ranges.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"205\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wYa9BMaoNPQ/UES4z4ODaYI/AAAAAAAAKP8/bAZzpPepDoo/s400/Post+Ranges.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>Because of this lack of volatility in the last stage of the campaign, the projected seat ranges are relatively tight.<br /><br />The PQ is projected to win between 57 and 75 seats, straddling the line of a majority government but not overlapping with any of the other parties: the Liberals are projected to win between 25 and 39 seats and the CAQ between 20 and 31 seats. The fight, then, is between these two parties for the role of the Official Opposition. As most of the battles are not between the Liberals and the CAQ, however, if the CAQ over-achieves and manages to place second there is a greater chance that the PQ will be reduced to a minority. On the other hand, if Liberal support tanks the PQ is most likely to take advantage and form a majority government.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gjIEwKSdXrc/UES5wS1HAcI/AAAAAAAAKQE/rB0_CDiADOs/s1600/Post+No+Adjustment.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"191\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gjIEwKSdXrc/UES5wS1HAcI/AAAAAAAAKQE/rB0_CDiADOs/s200/Post+No+Adjustment.PNG\" width=\"200\" /></a>The question of how voting intentions will differ from actual votes has been an important one for this campaign, as the projection model bets that the PQ and PLQ will be under-estimated and the CAQ and QS over-estimated.<br /><br />But if that does not occur, and if the polls are bang-on, it would not change much. Removing the turnout adjustment from the projection and instead using only the poll average, the PQ would still win with 61 seats - just below a majority government. The Liberals would still form the Official Opposition with 33 seats and the CAQ would win 29 seats.<br /><br />The ranges would put the PQ at between 53 and 75 seats, the Liberals at between 24 and 38 seats, the CAQ between 21 and 36 seats, and QuÃ©bec Solidaire between one and three seats. In other words, the projection would move from leaning towards a PQ majority to leaning towards a PQ minority, while the Liberals and CAQ would have almost even odds at forming the Official Opposition. Hardly paradigm-shifting.<br /><br />Now that we have gone over the general outline of the projection, let&apos;s look at it in further detail by going through it party-by-party.<br /><br /><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XyJZPcEWaiE/UES7F8yGMDI/AAAAAAAAKQM/5dtDKNN18TU/s1600/PQ.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XyJZPcEWaiE/UES7F8yGMDI/AAAAAAAAKQM/5dtDKNN18TU/s400/PQ.PNG\" width=\"162\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Click to zoom</td></tr></tbody></table>Though the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois is almost certain to finish on the top of the pile tomorrow night, the campaign will not have been one of their shining moments. A win is a win, of course, but the PQ is likely to emerge victorious with less of the vote than they earned in their 2008 defeat (35.2%), not to mention their defeats of 1985 and 1989.<br /><br />The big unknown is whether the PQ will be able to win a majority government. They are on the cusp of one, meaning that a handful of votes in a handful of ridings could make the difference. Will supporters of Option Nationale and QuÃ©bec Solidaire swing over to the PQ to give them a majority? Or will the PQ slip through on their own?<br /><br />The PQ is projected to win between 32.8% and 35.5% of the vote, which runs the gamut of a middling minority to a strong majority government. They appear to have the support of 37.3% of francophones, precariously close to minority territory, while they also have the support of 9.2% of non-francophones.<br /><br />Their best regions are in eastern Quebec and the Montreal suburbs, where the party is expected to win half of their seats. Eastern Quebec is particularly strong for the PQ, as they should sweep the GaspÃ©sie, the Saguenay, and the CÃ´te-Nord with 43.4% of the vote. They are also looking good in the Montreal suburbs with 39.5% support, but with between 15 and 24 seats it is the region where their majority government will likely be won or lost. They are fighting the CAQ north of the city and the Liberals in Laval, primarily.<br /><br />On the island of Montreal, however, the PQ is likely to re-elect all of their incumbents except Nicolas Girard in Gouin, though the projection does consider a Girard victory possible. How the QS vote will turnout could determine whether the PQ is able to win any new seats on the island. The PQ should do well in the Mauricie region of central Quebec, while they should win two seats in Quebec City (but could win between one and three).<br /><br />With the lone possibility of a single seat in Quebec City, if the PQ wins a majority government they should be well-represented in every part of the province. If they are given a minority, it will likely be because the Quebecers who live in the suburbs of Montreal defect to the CAQ, like they did in 2007 when they swung to the ADQ. That will be the region to watch.<br /><br /><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-R9wS6qSQ77Q/UES93CLhOcI/AAAAAAAAKQg/pA_M3IqNa9A/s1600/PLQ.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-R9wS6qSQ77Q/UES93CLhOcI/AAAAAAAAKQg/pA_M3IqNa9A/s400/PLQ.PNG\" width=\"151\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Click to zoom</td></tr></tbody></table>Jean Charest&apos;s Liberals started the campaign in a surprisingly good position, considering the problems the party and government has had in its third mandate. The Liberals were within a couple of points of the PQ and with a good campaign could have managed to be re-elected to a minority government. FranÃ§ois Legault got off to a running start with the candidacy of Jacques Duchesneau, which brought the corruption issue to the forefront, and from that point the Liberals saw their re-election chances drop to nil.<br /><br />But they still have some solid bases of support. The projection gives them between 26.9% and 28.9% of the vote, enough to keep them in the running for the job of the Official Opposition. They have the support of 61.4% of non-francophones, which gives them a good chunk of seats automatically, but only 19.6% support among francophones. That means a lot of defeated incumbents off the island of Montreal.<br /><br />That is their best region, where 20 of their 33 seats are likely to come from. They lead with 36.8% but are in danger of being reduced to as few as 16 seats on the island, depending on how the PQ vote turns out.<br /><br />Elsewhere, the party is in dire straits. After leading at the outset, the Liberals have dropped precipitously in Quebec City. They are projected to win 27.1% of the vote but only between zero and four seats. In the suburbs around Montreal they could win three or six, thanks in large part to residual support in Laval.<br /><br />In eastern and central Quebec, the party might only win three seats. The four seats in the Outaouais projected to go Liberal, meanwhile, is the only pocket of concentrated Liberal support outside the West Island.<br /><br />But I think the Liberals should not be under-estimated. The possibility exists where support for the Liberals will simply tank as voters decide that they can&apos;t support this nine-year-old government and will cast their ballot for a party that can win. However, the Liberals have a good organization and are the go-to option for convinced federalists, so I would not be surprised to see the Liberals over-achieve expectations. That could, for example, play out in Sherbrooke. Jean Charest is projected to lose, but it is always risky to bet against Charest. If one Liberal riding is going to be missed by the projection, I expect it to be this one. On the other hand, a gap of 12 or so points like the one recorded in the last Segma poll is also easy to imagine. The survivability of Liberal incumbents could be one major factor tomorrow night that prevents the CAQ from finishing second.<br /><br /><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rV7K0f42z24/UETDweTE_KI/AAAAAAAAKQ0/6tvTiJiIgEg/s1600/CAQ.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rV7K0f42z24/UETDweTE_KI/AAAAAAAAKQ0/6tvTiJiIgEg/s400/CAQ.PNG\" width=\"156\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Click to zoom</td></tr></tbody></table>The projection believes the CAQ will finish third, however. The CAQ has decent support but it lacks efficiency and concentration. They are lagging behind the PQ among francophones by seven points, and are likely to finish a strong second in a lot more ridings than the Liberals will. But the CAQ is the big unknown of tomorrow night - will they over-achieve or under-achieve? If anyone has momentum, it is the CAQ - and they also have the &apos;change&apos; card in their deck. But they lack an organization and the kind of enthusiasm needed to make-up for that deficient ground game. And will their support emerge in unexpected places?<br /><br />With between 24.8% and 27.8% projected support, the CAQ does have a chance of finishing second in the popular vote. Even so, the odds are against them finishing second in the seat count, due to the Liberal advantage in Montreal. They have the support of 30.3% of francophones and 18.1% of non-francophones, a very respectable score for FranÃ§ois Legault. But neither of those numbers are high enough to put the CAQ over the top.<br /><br />Their two strongest regions are Quebec City and central Quebec. The CAQ is projected to win seven of 11 seats in the capital, and lead with 37.4%. In central Quebec, particularly in ChaudiÃ¨re-Appalaches and parts of Estrie and the Centre-du-QuÃ©bec, the CAQ is well placed to win a swathe of seats as well.<br /><br />Whether they form the Official Opposition could be decided in the Montreal suburbs, where they are projected to win seven seats (including those of Legault, Duchesneau, and GaÃ©tan Barrette). They could bump that up to nine, but the polls have not moved in their favour in this region enough to give them many more seats.<br /><br />The party is weaker in eastern and western Quebec, where only a handful of seats might go their way. They are expected to be shut out from the island of Montreal, though with 17.1% support they have done much better than the ADQ.<br /><br />The CAQ is the hardest party to project in this election because of its status as a \"new\" party. The polls indicate that the CAQ is following in the footsteps of the ADQ, but there is a strong possibility that their support could be higher or lower than expected in certain ridings. The three ridings occupied by the floor-crossers (Blainville, Deux-Montagnes, and Sanguinet) are particularly mysterious. The model awards bonuses to floor-crossers as they take their old votes with them, but it is hard to say if that will happen with these three CAQ incumbents. These are three seats that I suspect could go a different way tomorrow night than expected, particularly Blainville where the PQ has a strong candidate. If that occurs, though, the odds of a CAQ Official Opposition diminish considerably.<br /><br />If any party is going to cause a surprise in the polls, it is the CAQ. How their vote turns out will likely decide the result of the election.<br /><br /><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8uzX2IcFRH0/UETGNw9LCsI/AAAAAAAAKRI/b1tva1aev10/s1600/QS.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8uzX2IcFRH0/UETGNw9LCsI/AAAAAAAAKRI/b1tva1aev10/s320/QS.PNG\" width=\"151\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Click to zoom</td></tr></tbody></table>How the votes of QuÃ©bec Solidaire will turnout will also be very important. From less than 4% in 2008, QS has done fairly well in this election. They are projected to almost double their support, and if things go very well for them they could more than double their vote haul.<br /><br />The party has 7.6% support among francophones and 4.7% support among non-francophones, a decent split for a party that has their best shot in some of the most multi-cultural parts of Montreal.<br /><br />That is where their election will play out, as the projection gives them 12.1% on the island. They could also take as much as 16.1%, but the projection does not award QS the possibility of more than two seats.<br /><br />Personally, I would not be shocked to see QS win three or four. They have a good shot in Laurier-Dorion and Sainte-Marie-Saint-Jacques, two ridings where QuÃ©bec Solidaire&apos;s maximum result is three points or less from being within range of making the ridings potential pick-ups. Amir Khadir was not expected to win in Mercier in 2008, so we should not be surprised if QS is able to over-achieve in these two ridings.<br /><br />Outside of Montreal, QS is not in the running for any other seats. They are not expected to get more than 6% support in any other region of the province. They could put up some good scores in Hull and Taschereau, but in neither of those ridings is the expected winner low enough to put QS within range.<br /><br />If QS manages to get both Khadir and FranÃ§oise David elected, they should consider the election a success. Having their two strongest personalities in the National Assembly will make it much easier for them to win three or four seats in the next election. If they manage to pull that off this time, the election will be a smashing success.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OblduHZMyGY/UETIYtabYrI/AAAAAAAAKRQ/rdCsNQva1Wk/s1600/ON.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OblduHZMyGY/UETIYtabYrI/AAAAAAAAKRQ/rdCsNQva1Wk/s200/ON.PNG\" width=\"200\" /></a>Meanwhile, the survival of Option Nationale depends on whether their leader is re-elected in Nicolet-BÃ©cancour. The projection does not expect that to happen, but it also does not rule it out. It is very difficult to estimate what will happen in this riding. The polls have shown that either Jean-Martin Aussant or the CAQ&apos;s candidate could win, but the samples have been so small that the riding can be considered a four-way race. If Aussant is not elected, ON will not survive as a viable party. If he is re-elected, it has a shot.<br /><br />But its support is very small and the party is unlikely to hit double-digits in any riding aside from Aussant&apos;s. That they managed to put 121 candidates on the ballot is remarkable for such a young party, but while its youth gives it some of the most enthusiastic support it also provides a handicap. Young people don&apos;t vote in the same numbers as older people.<br /><br />People who support Option Nationale would likely vote PQ or QS if the party was not on the ballot. Aside from seeing whether Aussant gets re-elected, it will be interesting to see whether ON will end up costing either PQ or QS any seats.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yfg43JPOZ_c/UETJig0jUoI/AAAAAAAAKRY/VBCoaTFj0H4/s1600/PVQ.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yfg43JPOZ_c/UETJig0jUoI/AAAAAAAAKRY/VBCoaTFj0H4/s200/PVQ.PNG\" width=\"197\" /></a>This was a horrible campaign for the Green Party. Their leader, Claude Sabourin, was unable to get himself in the news aside from a story in which a reporter from <i>La Presse</i>&amp;nbsp;was able to get himself nominated as a Green candidate without any sort of background check.<br /><br />With little more than half of a full slate, this is the worst performance for the Greens since 2003. They are not expected to take more than 2% of the vote, and are more likely to get 1%. Sabourin might manage double-digits in Notre-Dame-de-GrÃ¢ce, but any shot the Greens had at strong performances were lost when the CAQ emerged as the alternative choice of anglophones.<br /><br /><b>One long night, many questions to answer</b><br /><b><br /></b> Let&apos;s be honest - no one will look at polls and projections the same again after the Alberta campaign. Never mind that it was an extraordinarily exceptional event, there will always be some (including Jean Charest) who will point to that result as a reason to never believe polls ever again. Tomorrow will determine whether he has a point. If something like that happens, the race is close enough that any of the three main parties could win. I really don&apos;t think something like that will happen, but let&apos;s take the opportunity to recognize that no one can ever be 100% certain of anything when it comes to democracy.<br /><br />Putting that aside, Quebec appears to be almost certainly headed towards a PQ government. The question that will be answered tomorrow night is whether they will be awarded a minority or majority government. If the PQ does not get a majority, their minority is likely to be so large that a scenario where Jean Charest remains in power is unimaginable. So that is really what is at stake, and it will be up to those swing voters hesitating between QS/ON and the PQ, the CAQ and the PQ, and the Liberals and the CAQ to decide.<br /><br />Then there is the question of who will form the Official Opposition. If the Liberal vote turns out, their vote efficiency virtually assures they will finish second. If it doesn&apos;t, or if the CAQ gets a boost in support in the last days of the campaign, then FranÃ§ois Legault will become the Leader of the Official Opposition. If Jean Charest is not elected in his riding of Sherbrooke, Legault will likely become the de facto head of the opposition either way.<br /><br />In addition to those two big questions, there are many small ones to answer. Will FranÃ§oise David be elected? Can QS win a third or fourth seat? Will Jean-Martin Aussant return to the National Assembly? Will voters be scared off from the PQ because of the threat of a referendum? Will Jacques Duchesneau, GaÃ©tan Barrette, LÃ©o Bureau-Blouin, the CAQ <i>transfuges</i>,&amp;nbsp;and even FranÃ§ois Legault win in their ridings?<br /><br />It will be a long and fascinating night.<img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/623376556094758746-8344754545077479284?l=www.threehundredeight.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',1348689590,NULL,NULL,'Ã‰ric','http://www.blogger.com/profile/06849352443716808247','2012-09-03T16:00:00.005-04:00',NULL,'ThreeHundredEight.com',NULL,'Tomorrow night, ThreeHundredEight.com projects that Pauline Marois and the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois will win the Quebec provincial election with a plurality or majority of the National Assembly&apos;s 125 seats. <a href=\"http://www.threehundredeight.com/p/quebec.html\">Though the projection leans slightly towards a majority government</a>, the margin is too close to definitively project with confidence what form the government will take.<br /><br /><i>This post was updated on September 4, 2012 - see below.</i><br /><br />Similarly, either the Liberals or the Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec will emerge as the Official Opposition. It is more likely that the Liberals will be given the job, but the CAQ is also capable of jumping from third to second spot in Quebec City.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--qMiz_-wl1Y/UES2yFHpOXI/AAAAAAAAKP0/RYDUSJG71rM/s1600/Post.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--qMiz_-wl1Y/UES2yFHpOXI/AAAAAAAAKP0/RYDUSJG71rM/s320/Post.PNG\" width=\"159\" /></a>With 34.1% support, the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois is projected to win 63 seats tomorrow night. That is the bare minimum for a majority government. The Liberals, with 27.9% support, are projected to win 33 seats. That narrowly edges out the CAQ, who are projected to take 26.3% of the vote and 27 seats.<br /><br />The PQ&apos;s wobbly majority (if the Speaker is from the party, the Assembly would be split straight down the middle) is likely to get some support from QuÃ©bec Solidaire. The party is projected to win 7.1% of the vote and two seats.<br /><br />Option Nationale is projected to take 2.5% of the vote, while the Green Party of Quebec and other parties are expected to get 1% of the vote each.<br /><br />This campaign has shown a remarkable amount of stability for all of the noise that has come out of the province. Since the campaign began, neither CROP nor LÃ©ger Marketing have pegged PQ support at anything other than 32%, 33%, or 34% support, with no discernible change in support since the beginning of the campaign. The Liberals have dropped from around 30% to around 27%, but aside from the Forum poll the Liberals have been steady since before the series of four debates. The CAQ has also been very steady in the last bit of the campaign. They did experience a bump from the early days, but it was only an increase of a handful of points (LÃ©ger had them at 28% in their final poll of the campaign and at 27% in their poll from Aug. 6-8).<br /><br />This leads me to believe that we should not expect any sort of late swing over the final four unpolled days of the campaign (Sept. 1 to 4). If things weren&apos;t moving with a debate and the myriad of rather intense stories over the course of the election, why would they suddenly swing in this last stage?<br /><br /><i><b>UPDATE (Sept. 4, 2012): </b>As they did at the end of the Alberta provincial campaign, Forum Research conducted a poll last night. They <a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/09/03/pq-headed-to-comfortable-majority-final-poll-before-quebec-election/\">released it through </a></i><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/09/03/pq-headed-to-comfortable-majority-final-poll-before-quebec-election/\">The National Post</a><i>. Frank Graves from EKOS Research also published the results of their own polling on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VoiceOfFranky/status/242770964516057089\">his Twitter feed</a>&amp;nbsp;before midnight.</i><br /><i><br /></i> <i>I will not be updating the projection to include this new information (it would be impossible to include EKOS&apos;s numbers as they only reported the topline results). Federal electoral law and the law in many provinces prohibits the publishing of new public opinion polls on Election Day. Whether projections would also be prohibited could potentially be up to the interpretation of a judge. But in addition to not wanting to run that risk, I believe ThreeHundredEight should try to follow the spirit of the law and not publish new projections on Election Day.</i><br /><i><br /></i> <i>The Forum poll, in any case, backs up the final projection. Like the projection, Forum says that LÃ©ger and CROP have under-estimated the PQ and the Liberals and have over-estimated the CAQ and QS. If Forum has it, then the PQ will win a majority government and almost certainly a number of seats within the projection&apos;s upper range for the party. Similarly, the Liberals will become the Official Opposition and the CAQ the third party. I am confident that the projected seat ranges will hold true when the ballots are counted tonight.</i><br /><i><br /></i> <i>EKOS&apos;s poll is another kettle of fish. While they have identical numbers for the PQ and the CAQ as does Forum Research, they have the Liberals at 23% instead of 29% and QS at 11% instead of 6%. That is a very important difference. Granted, EKOS published these numbers as part of a longer poll and as a means of calibrating their surveying model. But the firm can&apos;t put money in the pile and expect to get it back if their bet loses. Forum and EKOS are going for the glory, while LÃ©ger and CROP are safely ensconced in virtually identical numbers a few days back from the vote. It will be interesting to see who will turn out to be right. And in the post-mortem, I will post what the projection would have shown had I included the numbers from Forum and EKOS.</i><br /><i><br /></i> Perhaps the long weekend, one of those mythical opportunities for families and friends to discuss politics and make a collective decision, will play a role in tomorrow night&apos;s vote. But there is nothing to suggest that we should expect a wholesale swing from one party to another. The number of undecideds is not unusually high and though the CAQ&apos;s supporters seem the softest, this comes as no surprise considering they are a &apos;new&apos; party.<br /><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wYa9BMaoNPQ/UES4z4ODaYI/AAAAAAAAKP8/bAZzpPepDoo/s1600/Post+Ranges.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"205\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wYa9BMaoNPQ/UES4z4ODaYI/AAAAAAAAKP8/bAZzpPepDoo/s400/Post+Ranges.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>Because of this lack of volatility in the last stage of the campaign, the projected seat ranges are relatively tight.<br /><br />The PQ is projected to win between 57 and 75 seats, straddling the line of a majority government but not overlapping with any of the other parties: the Liberals are projected to win between 25 and 39 seats and the CAQ between 20 and 31 seats. The fight, then, is between these two parties for the role of the Official Opposition. As most of the battles are not between the Liberals and the CAQ, however, if the CAQ over-achieves and manages to place second there is a greater chance that the PQ will be reduced to a minority. On the other hand, if Liberal support tanks the PQ is most likely to take advantage and form a majority government.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gjIEwKSdXrc/UES5wS1HAcI/AAAAAAAAKQE/rB0_CDiADOs/s1600/Post+No+Adjustment.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"191\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gjIEwKSdXrc/UES5wS1HAcI/AAAAAAAAKQE/rB0_CDiADOs/s200/Post+No+Adjustment.PNG\" width=\"200\" /></a>The question of how voting intentions will differ from actual votes has been an important one for this campaign, as the projection model bets that the PQ and PLQ will be under-estimated and the CAQ and QS over-estimated.<br /><br />But if that does not occur, and if the polls are bang-on, it would not change much. Removing the turnout adjustment from the projection and instead using only the poll average, the PQ would still win with 61 seats - just below a majority government. The Liberals would still form the Official Opposition with 33 seats and the CAQ would win 29 seats.<br /><br />The ranges would put the PQ at between 53 and 75 seats, the Liberals at between 24 and 38 seats, the CAQ between 21 and 36 seats, and QuÃ©bec Solidaire between one and three seats. In other words, the projection would move from leaning towards a PQ majority to leaning towards a PQ minority, while the Liberals and CAQ would have almost even odds at forming the Official Opposition. Hardly paradigm-shifting.<br /><br />Now that we have gone over the general outline of the projection, let&apos;s look at it in further detail by going through it party-by-party.<br /><br /><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XyJZPcEWaiE/UES7F8yGMDI/AAAAAAAAKQM/5dtDKNN18TU/s1600/PQ.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XyJZPcEWaiE/UES7F8yGMDI/AAAAAAAAKQM/5dtDKNN18TU/s400/PQ.PNG\" width=\"162\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Click to zoom</td></tr></tbody></table>Though the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois is almost certain to finish on the top of the pile tomorrow night, the campaign will not have been one of their shining moments. A win is a win, of course, but the PQ is likely to emerge victorious with less of the vote than they earned in their 2008 defeat (35.2%), not to mention their defeats of 1985 and 1989.<br /><br />The big unknown is whether the PQ will be able to win a majority government. They are on the cusp of one, meaning that a handful of votes in a handful of ridings could make the difference. Will supporters of Option Nationale and QuÃ©bec Solidaire swing over to the PQ to give them a majority? Or will the PQ slip through on their own?<br /><br />The PQ is projected to win between 32.8% and 35.5% of the vote, which runs the gamut of a middling minority to a strong majority government. They appear to have the support of 37.3% of francophones, precariously close to minority territory, while they also have the support of 9.2% of non-francophones.<br /><br />Their best regions are in eastern Quebec and the Montreal suburbs, where the party is expected to win half of their seats. Eastern Quebec is particularly strong for the PQ, as they should sweep the GaspÃ©sie, the Saguenay, and the CÃ´te-Nord with 43.4% of the vote. They are also looking good in the Montreal suburbs with 39.5% support, but with between 15 and 24 seats it is the region where their majority government will likely be won or lost. They are fighting the CAQ north of the city and the Liberals in Laval, primarily.<br /><br />On the island of Montreal, however, the PQ is likely to re-elect all of their incumbents except Nicolas Girard in Gouin, though the projection does consider a Girard victory possible. How the QS vote will turnout could determine whether the PQ is able to win any new seats on the island. The PQ should do well in the Mauricie region of central Quebec, while they should win two seats in Quebec City (but could win between one and three).<br /><br />With the lone possibility of a single seat in Quebec City, if the PQ wins a majority government they should be well-represented in every part of the province. If they are given a minority, it will likely be because the Quebecers who live in the suburbs of Montreal defect to the CAQ, like they did in 2007 when they swung to the ADQ. That will be the region to watch.<br /><br /><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-R9wS6qSQ77Q/UES93CLhOcI/AAAAAAAAKQg/pA_M3IqNa9A/s1600/PLQ.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-R9wS6qSQ77Q/UES93CLhOcI/AAAAAAAAKQg/pA_M3IqNa9A/s400/PLQ.PNG\" width=\"151\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Click to zoom</td></tr></tbody></table>Jean Charest&apos;s Liberals started the campaign in a surprisingly good position, considering the problems the party and government has had in its third mandate. The Liberals were within a couple of points of the PQ and with a good campaign could have managed to be re-elected to a minority government. FranÃ§ois Legault got off to a running start with the candidacy of Jacques Duchesneau, which brought the corruption issue to the forefront, and from that point the Liberals saw their re-election chances drop to nil.<br /><br />But they still have some solid bases of support. The projection gives them between 26.9% and 28.9% of the vote, enough to keep them in the running for the job of the Official Opposition. They have the support of 61.4% of non-francophones, which gives them a good chunk of seats automatically, but only 19.6% support among francophones. That means a lot of defeated incumbents off the island of Montreal.<br /><br />That is their best region, where 20 of their 33 seats are likely to come from. They lead with 36.8% but are in danger of being reduced to as few as 16 seats on the island, depending on how the PQ vote turns out.<br /><br />Elsewhere, the party is in dire straits. After leading at the outset, the Liberals have dropped precipitously in Quebec City. They are projected to win 27.1% of the vote but only between zero and four seats. In the suburbs around Montreal they could win three or six, thanks in large part to residual support in Laval.<br /><br />In eastern and central Quebec, the party might only win three seats. The four seats in the Outaouais projected to go Liberal, meanwhile, is the only pocket of concentrated Liberal support outside the West Island.<br /><br />But I think the Liberals should not be under-estimated. The possibility exists where support for the Liberals will simply tank as voters decide that they can&apos;t support this nine-year-old government and will cast their ballot for a party that can win. However, the Liberals have a good organization and are the go-to option for convinced federalists, so I would not be surprised to see the Liberals over-achieve expectations. That could, for example, play out in Sherbrooke. Jean Charest is projected to lose, but it is always risky to bet against Charest. If one Liberal riding is going to be missed by the projection, I expect it to be this one. On the other hand, a gap of 12 or so points like the one recorded in the last Segma poll is also easy to imagine. The survivability of Liberal incumbents could be one major factor tomorrow night that prevents the CAQ from finishing second.<br /><br /><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rV7K0f42z24/UETDweTE_KI/AAAAAAAAKQ0/6tvTiJiIgEg/s1600/CAQ.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rV7K0f42z24/UETDweTE_KI/AAAAAAAAKQ0/6tvTiJiIgEg/s400/CAQ.PNG\" width=\"156\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Click to zoom</td></tr></tbody></table>The projection believes the CAQ will finish third, however. The CAQ has decent support but it lacks efficiency and concentration. They are lagging behind the PQ among francophones by seven points, and are likely to finish a strong second in a lot more ridings than the Liberals will. But the CAQ is the big unknown of tomorrow night - will they over-achieve or under-achieve? If anyone has momentum, it is the CAQ - and they also have the &apos;change&apos; card in their deck. But they lack an organization and the kind of enthusiasm needed to make-up for that deficient ground game. And will their support emerge in unexpected places?<br /><br />With between 24.8% and 27.8% projected support, the CAQ does have a chance of finishing second in the popular vote. Even so, the odds are against them finishing second in the seat count, due to the Liberal advantage in Montreal. They have the support of 30.3% of francophones and 18.1% of non-francophones, a very respectable score for FranÃ§ois Legault. But neither of those numbers are high enough to put the CAQ over the top.<br /><br />Their two strongest regions are Quebec City and central Quebec. The CAQ is projected to win seven of 11 seats in the capital, and lead with 37.4%. In central Quebec, particularly in ChaudiÃ¨re-Appalaches and parts of Estrie and the Centre-du-QuÃ©bec, the CAQ is well placed to win a swathe of seats as well.<br /><br />Whether they form the Official Opposition could be decided in the Montreal suburbs, where they are projected to win seven seats (including those of Legault, Duchesneau, and GaÃ©tan Barrette). They could bump that up to nine, but the polls have not moved in their favour in this region enough to give them many more seats.<br /><br />The party is weaker in eastern and western Quebec, where only a handful of seats might go their way. They are expected to be shut out from the island of Montreal, though with 17.1% support they have done much better than the ADQ.<br /><br />The CAQ is the hardest party to project in this election because of its status as a \"new\" party. The polls indicate that the CAQ is following in the footsteps of the ADQ, but there is a strong possibility that their support could be higher or lower than expected in certain ridings. The three ridings occupied by the floor-crossers (Blainville, Deux-Montagnes, and Sanguinet) are particularly mysterious. The model awards bonuses to floor-crossers as they take their old votes with them, but it is hard to say if that will happen with these three CAQ incumbents. These are three seats that I suspect could go a different way tomorrow night than expected, particularly Blainville where the PQ has a strong candidate. If that occurs, though, the odds of a CAQ Official Opposition diminish considerably.<br /><br />If any party is going to cause a surprise in the polls, it is the CAQ. How their vote turns out will likely decide the result of the election.<br /><br /><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8uzX2IcFRH0/UETGNw9LCsI/AAAAAAAAKRI/b1tva1aev10/s1600/QS.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8uzX2IcFRH0/UETGNw9LCsI/AAAAAAAAKRI/b1tva1aev10/s320/QS.PNG\" width=\"151\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Click to zoom</td></tr></tbody></table>How the votes of QuÃ©bec Solidaire will turnout will also be very important. From less than 4% in 2008, QS has done fairly well in this election. They are projected to almost double their support, and if things go very well for them they could more than double their vote haul.<br /><br />The party has 7.6% support among francophones and 4.7% support among non-francophones, a decent split for a party that has their best shot in some of the most multi-cultural parts of Montreal.<br /><br />That is where their election will play out, as the projection gives them 12.1% on the island. They could also take as much as 16.1%, but the projection does not award QS the possibility of more than two seats.<br /><br />Personally, I would not be shocked to see QS win three or four. They have a good shot in Laurier-Dorion and Sainte-Marie-Saint-Jacques, two ridings where QuÃ©bec Solidaire&apos;s maximum result is three points or less from being within range of making the ridings potential pick-ups. Amir Khadir was not expected to win in Mercier in 2008, so we should not be surprised if QS is able to over-achieve in these two ridings.<br /><br />Outside of Montreal, QS is not in the running for any other seats. They are not expected to get more than 6% support in any other region of the province. They could put up some good scores in Hull and Taschereau, but in neither of those ridings is the expected winner low enough to put QS within range.<br /><br />If QS manages to get both Khadir and FranÃ§oise David elected, they should consider the election a success. Having their two strongest personalities in the National Assembly will make it much easier for them to win three or four seats in the next election. If they manage to pull that off this time, the election will be a smashing success.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OblduHZMyGY/UETIYtabYrI/AAAAAAAAKRQ/rdCsNQva1Wk/s1600/ON.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OblduHZMyGY/UETIYtabYrI/AAAAAAAAKRQ/rdCsNQva1Wk/s200/ON.PNG\" width=\"200\" /></a>Meanwhile, the survival of Option Nationale depends on whether their leader is re-elected in Nicolet-BÃ©cancour. The projection does not expect that to happen, but it also does not rule it out. It is very difficult to estimate what will happen in this riding. The polls have shown that either Jean-Martin Aussant or the CAQ&apos;s candidate could win, but the samples have been so small that the riding can be considered a four-way race. If Aussant is not elected, ON will not survive as a viable party. If he is re-elected, it has a shot.<br /><br />But its support is very small and the party is unlikely to hit double-digits in any riding aside from Aussant&apos;s. That they managed to put 121 candidates on the ballot is remarkable for such a young party, but while its youth gives it some of the most enthusiastic support it also provides a handicap. Young people don&apos;t vote in the same numbers as older people.<br /><br />People who support Option Nationale would likely vote PQ or QS if the party was not on the ballot. Aside from seeing whether Aussant gets re-elected, it will be interesting to see whether ON will end up costing either PQ or QS any seats.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yfg43JPOZ_c/UETJig0jUoI/AAAAAAAAKRY/VBCoaTFj0H4/s1600/PVQ.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yfg43JPOZ_c/UETJig0jUoI/AAAAAAAAKRY/VBCoaTFj0H4/s200/PVQ.PNG\" width=\"197\" /></a>This was a horrible campaign for the Green Party. Their leader, Claude Sabourin, was unable to get himself in the news aside from a story in which a reporter from <i>La Presse</i>&amp;nbsp;was able to get himself nominated as a Green candidate without any sort of background check.<br /><br />With little more than half of a full slate, this is the worst performance for the Greens since 2003. They are not expected to take more than 2% of the vote, and are more likely to get 1%. Sabourin might manage double-digits in Notre-Dame-de-GrÃ¢ce, but any shot the Greens had at strong performances were lost when the CAQ emerged as the alternative choice of anglophones.<br /><br /><b>One long night, many questions to answer</b><br /><b><br /></b> Let&apos;s be honest - no one will look at polls and projections the same again after the Alberta campaign. Never mind that it was an extraordinarily exceptional event, there will always be some (including Jean Charest) who will point to that result as a reason to never believe polls ever again. Tomorrow will determine whether he has a point. If something like that happens, the race is close enough that any of the three main parties could win. I really don&apos;t think something like that will happen, but let&apos;s take the opportunity to recognize that no one can ever be 100% certain of anything when it comes to democracy.<br /><br />Putting that aside, Quebec appears to be almost certainly headed towards a PQ government. The question that will be answered tomorrow night is whether they will be awarded a minority or majority government. If the PQ does not get a majority, their minority is likely to be so large that a scenario where Jean Charest remains in power is unimaginable. So that is really what is at stake, and it will be up to those swing voters hesitating between QS/ON and the PQ, the CAQ and the PQ, and the Liberals and the CAQ to decide.<br /><br />Then there is the question of who will form the Official Opposition. If the Liberal vote turns out, their vote efficiency virtually assures they will finish second. If it doesn&apos;t, or if the CAQ gets a boost in support in the last days of the campaign, then FranÃ§ois Legault will become the Leader of the Official Opposition. If Jean Charest is not elected in his riding of Sherbrooke, Legault will likely become the de facto head of the opposition either way.<br /><br />In addition to those two big questions, there are many small ones to answer. Will FranÃ§oise David be elected? Can QS win a third or fourth seat? Will Jean-Martin Aussant return to the National Assembly? Will voters be scared off from the PQ because of the threat of a referendum? Will Jacques Duchesneau, GaÃ©tan Barrette, LÃ©o Bureau-Blouin, the CAQ <i>transfuges</i>,&amp;nbsp;and even FranÃ§ois Legault win in their ridings?<br /><br />It will be a long and fascinating night.<img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/623376556094758746-8344754545077479284?l=www.threehundredeight.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'News','News',NULL),(91,0,0,'PQ on verge of losing majority','text/html','http://www.threehundredeight.com/2012/08/pq-on-verge-of-losing-majority.html','40th Quebec General Election;Canada',NULL,NULL,2,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-31 13:41:59',6,'Polls from <a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/08/30/poll-shows-marois-pq-winning-a-slight-majority-in-quebec-election/\">Forum Research for <i>The National Post</i></a>&amp;nbsp;and <a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/elections-quebec-2012/201208/30/01-4569848-sondage-le-pq-minoritaire-chaude-lutte-pour-lopposition.php?utm_categorieinterne=trafficdrivers&amp;amp;utm_contenuinterne=cyberpresse_B9_elections-quebec-2012_1965459_accueil_POS3\">CROP for <i>La Presse</i></a>&amp;nbsp;have been added to the <a href=\"http://www.threehundredeight.com/p/quebec.html\">projection</a>. Together, they suggest that the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois&apos;s quest for a majority is on a knife&apos;s edge, and that the role of the Official Opposition is still very much up for grabs.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LN6z1MKgyYg/UEDwbD3-8lI/AAAAAAAAKNo/IZmuji_wPDs/s1600/Post.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LN6z1MKgyYg/UEDwbD3-8lI/AAAAAAAAKNo/IZmuji_wPDs/s320/Post.PNG\" width=\"153\" /></a>The projection awards the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois 33.7% support, compared to 28.1% for the Liberals and 26% for the Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec. In fourth is QuÃ©bec Solidaire, at their highest point in the campaign with 7.8% support.<br /><br />This would deliver 64 seats to the PQ, 33 to the Liberals, 26 to the CAQ, and two to QuÃ©bec Solidaire. As 63 seats are needed for a majority government, the PQ is really on the edge. If the projection is off by two seats, which would be a great result, it would mean the difference between minority and majority.<br /><br />The ranges show, however, that the PQ is the only party in the running for government. They could win between 54 and 73 seats, straddling the majority line almost exactly. The Liberals, with between 27 and 43 seats, are well placed to form the Official Opposition (and they can thank Montreal for that), but the CAQ could also take on the job with between 19 and 32 seats.<br /><br />QuÃ©bec Solidaire, with between one and two seats, and Option Nationale, with potentially one seat, could hold the balance of power.<br /><br />The CAQ has been making gains in central Quebec and the suburbs around Montreal, putting a lot of pressure on the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois. They are doing very well in Quebec City but are not strong enough in other parts of the province to have a shot at forming government. The Liberals, with their solid base of support in Montreal and the Outaouais (22 of their 33 seats), have a head-start on the CAQ.<br /><br />The turnout adjustment benefits the PQ and the Liberals only slightly in terms of seats. Without the adjustment, the poll averages alone would still deliver 32 seats to the Liberals and 61 to the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois. That means a minority, but with the two seats from QuÃ©bec Solidaire the PQ could make it work. The CAQ, with 30 seats, still ends up in third place even with a second place finish in the popular vote.<br /><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g13t9aWZq8A/UEDx5IWMUjI/AAAAAAAAKNw/SL3pAvWuwrA/s1600/Crop.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"268\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g13t9aWZq8A/UEDx5IWMUjI/AAAAAAAAKNw/SL3pAvWuwrA/s400/Crop.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>The unexpected CROP poll of this morning shows very little change from their last poll of Aug. 24-26. The PQ is down one point to 32% while the CAQ and PLQ are steady at 28% and 26%, respectively. With a two point gain, QuÃ©bec Solidaire is now at 9%.<br /><br />All of these shifts are within the margin of error, however, suggesting that things are now solidifying. The CAQ needs to continue its momentum in order to have a shot, but that does not seem to be in the cards for them.<br /><br />But it is worth noting that while the shifts in support are statistically insignificant, the lead the PQ holds over the CAQ is as well (just). We also can&apos;t say with absolute certainty that the CAQ is ahead of the Liberals (though we can say that the PQ is). It makes for a potentially interesting finish on Tuesday night.<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2U3vEVvzebE/UEDyiA5HW2I/AAAAAAAAKN4/MNeTiFa3VVE/s1600/Forum.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"263\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2U3vEVvzebE/UEDyiA5HW2I/AAAAAAAAKN4/MNeTiFa3VVE/s400/Forum.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>Forum fell into line with everyone else after their stand-out poll from last week, but the firm still seems to be showing better numbers for the Liberals. Perhaps the IVR method overcomes a \"shy Tory\" factor for the PLQ. We will find out on election night.<br /><br />Since that last poll of Aug. 20, the PQ has gained four points and leads with 33%, followed by the Liberals at 28% (-7), the CAQ at 27% (+3), and QuÃ©bec Solidaire at 8% (-1).<br /><br />Together, these two polls tell a similar story of a close three-way race. The PQ has the advantage but neither the CAQ nor the PLQ are taking on runner-up status. The CAQ is ahead in Quebec City and the PQ elsewhere, while QS is doing better than they were before the debates.<br /><br />We will have to wait and see what LÃ©ger Marketing says with their final poll, expected this weekend.<br /><br /><b>Riding polls</b><br /><b><br /></b> A large amount of riding polls were released in the last few days, and all have been added to the projection. Let&apos;s go through them quickly.<br /><br />A poll for <i>Le Soleil</i>&amp;nbsp;by Segma in <b><a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/le-soleil/dossiers/elections-quebecoises/201208/29/01-4569089-sondage-segma-large-avance-pour-le-pq-dans-taschereau.php\">Taschereau</a></b>&amp;nbsp;found AgnÃ¨s Maltais of the PQ well ahead of ClÃ©ment Gignac of the Liberals, with 41% to 19%. QS and the CAQ tied for third with 16% apiece. The projection also showed Maltais as the likely winner.<br /><br />Another Segma poll for <i>Le Voix de l&apos;Est</i>&amp;nbsp;in <b><a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/la-voix-de-lest/actualites/201208/29/01-4569083-sondage-segmala-voix-de-lest-dans-brome-missisquoi-paradis-en-danger.php\">Brome-Missisquoi</a></b>&amp;nbsp;found a close three-way race. Benoit Legault of the CAQ came out ahead with 32% to Richard Leclerc&apos;s 31%. The incumbent Liberal, Pierre Paradis, was in third with 27%. The projection also shows a close three-way race, but gives Paradis the advantage.<br /><br />A poll in <b><a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/le-droit/dossiers/elections-quebecoises-2012/201208/28/01-4569054-le-bastion-liberal-de-papineau-secoue-par-le-pq.php?utm_categorieinterne=trafficdrivers&amp;amp;utm_contenuinterne=cyberpresse_B13b_ottawagatineau_546_section_POS2\">Papineau</a></b>&amp;nbsp;by Segma for <i>Le Droit</i>&amp;nbsp;put Jean-FranÃ§ois Primeau of the PQ ahead with 36%, followed at length by Alexandre Iraca of the Liberals with 27%. It confirmed the projection&apos;s prediction that Papineau would go PQ, but it did not give Primeau such a large lead in the formally safe Liberal riding.<br /><br />Three polls by Forum Research for the <i>Stantead Journal</i>&amp;nbsp;showed close races in Estrie: 36% for the Liberals to 35% for the PQ in <b>Orford</b>, 39% for the PQ to 37% for the Liberals in <b>Saint-FranÃ§ois</b>, and 41% for Serge Cardin of the PQ to 39% for Jean Charest in <b>Sherbrooke</b>. That last one is of some interest, considering the leads that Segma has given Cardin in two polls.<br /><br />Moving on to the GaspÃ©sie, two polls by Segma agreed with 308 that the PQ could win <a href=\"http://www.graffici.ca/nouvelles/sondage-possible-balayage-pequiste-gaspesie-1252/\"><b>Bonaventure</b>&amp;nbsp;and <b>GaspÃ©</b></a>, but the poll for <i>Graffici</i>&amp;nbsp;put the Liberals much further behind in the latter: 57% for GaÃ©tan LeliÃ¨vre in GaspÃ© to 20% for the incumbent Georges Mamelonet. It showed a closer race in Bonaventure, with 41% for Sylvain Roy of the PQ to 34% for Damien Arsenault of the PLQ.<br /><br />Another poll in <a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/la-tribune/sherbrooke/201208/30/01-4569475-sondage-confortable-avance-pour-hebert-dans-st-francois.php\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Saint-FranÃ§ois</a>, this time&amp;nbsp;by Segma for <i>La Tribune,</i>&amp;nbsp;gave the PQ&apos;s RÃ©jean HÃ©bert a 20 point lead over Nathalie Goguen, with 46% to 26%. That is much more in line with what the projection had.<br /><br />And finally, five polls this morning by Segma for <i>Le Quotidien</i>&amp;nbsp;in <a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/le-quotidien/le-quotidien-du-jour/201208/31/01-4569937-balayage-pequiste-dans-la-region.php?utm_categorieinterne=trafficdrivers&amp;amp;utm_contenuinterne=cyberpresse_B4_en-manchette_322_section_POS1\"><b>Dubuc, Chicoutimi, JonquiÃ¨re, Roberval, </b>and <b>Lac-Saint-Jean</b></a>&amp;nbsp;confirmed that the PQ is poised to sweep the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. Interestingly, however, in all of the ridings except Roberval the CAQ has moved into second, ahead of the Liberals. On average, the CAQ gained six points in these ridings since Segma&apos;s last poll of the region between Aug. 11-16. Both the PQ and the Liberals have lost three points. This is a strong indication of how the Liberals are suffering in francophone Quebec, but also how the PQ is relatively stagnant. Remember that the PQ is likely to win the election on Tuesday with less of the vote than they took in their 2008 defeat.<img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/623376556094758746-1124418794815080854?l=www.threehundredeight.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',1348689591,NULL,NULL,'Ã‰ric','http://www.blogger.com/profile/06849352443716808247','2012-08-31T13:41:00.000-04:00',NULL,'ThreeHundredEight.com',NULL,'Polls from <a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/08/30/poll-shows-marois-pq-winning-a-slight-majority-in-quebec-election/\">Forum Research for <i>The National Post</i></a>&amp;nbsp;and <a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/elections-quebec-2012/201208/30/01-4569848-sondage-le-pq-minoritaire-chaude-lutte-pour-lopposition.php?utm_categorieinterne=trafficdrivers&amp;amp;utm_contenuinterne=cyberpresse_B9_elections-quebec-2012_1965459_accueil_POS3\">CROP for <i>La Presse</i></a>&amp;nbsp;have been added to the <a href=\"http://www.threehundredeight.com/p/quebec.html\">projection</a>.

It makes for a potentially interesting finish on Tuesday night.<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2U3vEVvzebE/UEDyiA5HW2I/AAAAAAAAKN4/MNeTiFa3VVE/s1600/Forum.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"263\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2U3vEVvzebE/UEDyiA5HW2I/AAAAAAAAKN4/MNeTiFa3VVE/s400/Forum.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>Forum fell into line with everyone else after their stand-out poll from last week, but the firm still seems to be showing better numbers for the Liberals. Perhaps the IVR method overcomes a \"shy Tory\" factor for the PLQ. We will find out on election night.<br /><br />Since that last poll of Aug. 20, the PQ has gained four points and leads with 33%, followed by the Liberals at 28% (-7), the CAQ at 27% (+3), and QuÃ©bec Solidaire at 8% (-1).<br /><br />Together, these two polls tell a similar story of a close three-way race. The PQ has the advantage but neither the CAQ nor the PLQ are taking on runner-up status. The CAQ is ahead in Quebec City and the PQ elsewhere, while QS is doing better than they were before the debates.<br /><br />We will have to wait and see what LÃ©ger Marketing says with their final poll, expected this weekend.<br /><br /><b>Riding polls</b><br /><b><br /></b> A large amount of riding polls were released in the last few days, and all have been added to the projection. Let&apos;s go through them quickly.<br /><br />A poll for <i>Le Soleil</i>&amp;nbsp;by Segma in <b><a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/le-soleil/dossiers/elections-quebecoises/201208/29/01-4569089-sondage-segma-large-avance-pour-le-pq-dans-taschereau.php\">Taschereau</a></b>&amp;nbsp;found AgnÃ¨s Maltais of the PQ well ahead of ClÃ©ment Gignac of the Liberals, with 41% to 19%. QS and the CAQ tied for third with 16% apiece. The projection also showed Maltais as the likely winner.<br /><br />Another Segma poll for <i>Le Voix de l&apos;Est</i>&amp;nbsp;in <b><a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/la-voix-de-lest/actualites/201208/29/01-4569083-sondage-segmala-voix-de-lest-dans-brome-missisquoi-paradis-en-danger.php\">Brome-Missisquoi</a></b>&amp;nbsp;found a close three-way race. Benoit Legault of the CAQ came out ahead with 32% to Richard Leclerc&apos;s 31%. The incumbent Liberal, Pierre Paradis, was in third with 27%. The projection also shows a close three-way race, but gives Paradis the advantage.<br /><br />A poll in <b><a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/le-droit/dossiers/elections-quebecoises-2012/201208/28/01-4569054-le-bastion-liberal-de-papineau-secoue-par-le-pq.php?utm_categorieinterne=trafficdrivers&amp;amp;utm_contenuinterne=cyberpresse_B13b_ottawagatineau_546_section_POS2\">Papineau</a></b>&amp;nbsp;by Segma for <i>Le Droit</i>&amp;nbsp;put Jean-FranÃ§ois Primeau of the PQ ahead with 36%, followed at length by Alexandre Iraca of the Liberals with 27%. It confirmed the projection&apos;s prediction that Papineau would go PQ, but it did not give Primeau such a large lead in the formally safe Liberal riding.<br /><br />Three polls by Forum Research for the <i>Stantead Journal</i>&amp;nbsp;showed close races in Estrie: 36% for the Liberals to 35% for the PQ in <b>Orford</b>, 39% for the PQ to 37% for the Liberals in <b>Saint-FranÃ§ois</b>, and 41% for Serge Cardin of the PQ to 39% for Jean Charest in <b>Sherbrooke</b>. That last one is of some interest, considering the leads that Segma has given Cardin in two polls.<br /><br />Moving on to the GaspÃ©sie, two polls by Segma agreed with 308 that the PQ could win <a href=\"http://www.graffici.ca/nouvelles/sondage-possible-balayage-pequiste-gaspesie-1252/\"><b>Bonaventure</b>&amp;nbsp;and <b>GaspÃ©</b></a>, but the poll for <i>Graffici</i>&amp;nbsp;put the Liberals much further behind in the latter: 57% for GaÃ©tan LeliÃ¨vre in GaspÃ© to 20% for the incumbent Georges Mamelonet. It showed a closer race in Bonaventure, with 41% for Sylvain Roy of the PQ to 34% for Damien Arsenault of the PLQ.<br /><br />Another poll in <a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/la-tribune/sherbrooke/201208/30/01-4569475-sondage-confortable-avance-pour-hebert-dans-st-francois.php\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Saint-FranÃ§ois</a>, this time&amp;nbsp;by Segma for <i>La Tribune,</i>&amp;nbsp;gave the PQ&apos;s RÃ©jean HÃ©bert a 20 point lead over Nathalie Goguen, with 46% to 26%. That is much more in line with what the projection had.<br /><br />And finally, five polls this morning by Segma for <i>Le Quotidien</i>&amp;nbsp;in <a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/le-quotidien/le-quotidien-du-jour/201208/31/01-4569937-balayage-pequiste-dans-la-region.php?utm_categorieinterne=trafficdrivers&amp;amp;utm_contenuinterne=cyberpresse_B4_en-manchette_322_section_POS1\"><b>Dubuc, Chicoutimi, JonquiÃ¨re, Roberval, </b>and <b>Lac-Saint-Jean</b></a>&amp;nbsp;confirmed that the PQ is poised to sweep the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. Interestingly, however, in all of the ridings except Roberval the CAQ has moved into second, ahead of the Liberals. On average, the CAQ gained six points in these ridings since Segma&apos;s last poll of the region between Aug. 11-16. Both the PQ and the Liberals have lost three points. This is a strong indication of how the Liberals are suffering in francophone Quebec, but also how the PQ is relatively stagnant. Remember that the PQ is likely to win the election on Tuesday with less of the vote than they took in their 2008 defeat.<img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/623376556094758746-1124418794815080854?l=www.threehundredeight.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'News','News',NULL),(92,0,0,'PQ still in majority territory, but less secure','text/html','http://www.threehundredeight.com/2012/08/pq-still-in-majority-territory-but-less.html','40th Quebec General Election;Canada',NULL,NULL,2,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-29 10:38:20',6,'A new poll by <a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/elections-quebec-2012/201208/27/01-4568731-sondage-le-parti-quebecois-en-terrain-minoritaire.php\">CROP for <i>La Presse</i></a>&amp;nbsp;confirmed the results of the weekend&apos;s LÃ©ger Marketing poll to within a percentage point, giving the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois a five-point lead over the (now) second place Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec.

QuÃ©bec Solidaire, with 6.8% support, is well behind the three frontrunners.<br /><br />The PQ is projected to win 67 seats, giving them four more than the bare minimum needed for a majority government. With 33 seats, the Liberals would form the Official Opposition while the CAQ would claim 24 seats and QS one.<br /><br />But this order of finish is far from certain. If an election were held today, the PQ could emerge with a minority or a majority, as the range puts them between 52 and 78 seats. Though the PQ&apos;s minimum ties with the Liberals&apos; maximum, it is extremely unlikely that the two parties would end up equal in seats.<br /><br />The Liberals should be more concerned with not finishing third, as the range puts them between 26 and 52 seats. That means they overlap with the CAQ&apos;s 12-32 seat range, and with FranÃ§ois Legault claiming a tiny bit of positive momentum to Jean Charest&apos;s negative trendlines, the odds are good that the CAQ could be in second place by the time the election rolls around.<br /><br />Regionally, the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois is leading in the Montreal suburbs (39.8% to the CAQ&apos;s 28.7% and the Liberals&apos; 20.9%) and in the eastern (43.9% to 25.7% for the PLQ) and western (38.8% to 25.8% for the Liberals and 24.2% for the CAQ) parts of the province.<br /><br />The Liberals only lead on the island of Montreal, though it is the widest lead in any region in Quebec. The Liberals have 46.2% support in the projection on the island, compared to 26.1% for the PQ and 13.6% for the CAQ.<br /><br />Legault&apos;s party, on the other hand, claims two leads. He is ahead in Quebec City with 36.5% support, trailed at length by the Liberals at 28.4% and the PQ at 25.1%. And in central Quebec, the CAQ is narrowly ahead with 33.2% to the PQ&apos;s 31% and the PLQ&apos;s 26.1%. It is a close three-way race, but the Liberals get the worst of it: the PQ is projected to win 10 seats in the region, with the CAQ winning nine and the Liberals only one.<br /><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mduVkn-J2j0/UDu1udeJAYI/AAAAAAAAKEw/BoWyuQ5f7W8/s1600/Leger.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"263\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mduVkn-J2j0/UDu1udeJAYI/AAAAAAAAKEw/BoWyuQ5f7W8/s400/Leger.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>The <a href=\"http://www.journaldemontreal.com/2012/08/25/pequiste-et-minoritaire\">LÃ©ger poll from Saturday</a> was eagerly awaited, as the only available set of numbers came in the form of the widely lampooned Forum Research poll.<br /><br />Rather than a big swing in favour of one party or another, LÃ©ger found things to be relatively stable since their poll of Aug. 13-16: the PQ unchanged at 33%, the CAQ up one to 28%, and the Liberals down one to 27%.<br /><br />Though the gap between the Liberals and the CAQ is well within the margin of error, making it impossible to claim with any certainty that the Liberals are in fact in third place, the psychological effect of that positioning could be catastrophic. If Legault and the CAQ appear to be the only real bulwark to the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois, the Liberals could shed federalist support over the next few days.<br /><br />While the gap between second and third was statistically insignificant, that between the PQ and the CAQ was not. The PQ also holds a significant lead among francophones with 38% (-2) to 31% (+2). The Liberals&apos; dominance among non-francophones remains unchallenged, however, with 67% support. The CAQ is down five points to 15% among this electorate.<br /><br />Though most movement was within the margin of error, some was noteworthy. QuÃ©bec Solidaire was up three points in the Montreal region to 9%, suggesting the performance of FranÃ§oise David in last Sunday&apos;s debate helped her party&apos;s fortunes. The CAQ was up eight big points in Quebec City to 46%, while the Liberals were up 11 on the island of Montreal to 45%.

But it is impossible to reconcile the two results for the CAQ. The truth likely lies somewhere in the middle, but one or both of these polls is likely a little off.<br /><br />Segma broke the results into the Rive-Nord (generally Quebec City itself) and the Rive-Sud (LÃ©vis and surroundings), finding the CAQ in the lead in both areas. The area around LÃ©vis was the last stronghold of the federal Conservatives in the last federal election, likely explaining the better CAQ results there. The PQ is much more competitive in Quebec City itself (and the projection accordingly has them in the running for four seats in the region, though one is more likely) but generally the race in and around the capital is between the CAQ and the PLQ.<br /><br /><b>Riding polls</b><br /><b><br /></b> There are pockets of stronger support for each party.

A poll by Cara-TÃ©lÃ©com for <i>La Nouvelle Union</i>&amp;nbsp;taken Aug. 21 found Claude Bachand of the Liberals to have 39.8% support in <b><a href=\"http://www.lanouvelle.net/%C3%89lections/Arthabaska/2012-08-24/article-3059768/Une-course-a-deux-dans-Arthabaska/1\">Arthabaska</a></b>, compared to 32.6% for the CAQ&apos;s Sylvie Roy and 18.1% for the PQ candidate. With a large margin of error, Bachand is not out of the woods.<br /><br />And a poll by BaromÃ¨tre of <a href=\"http://www.lhebdojournal.com/Elections/2012-08-25/article-3060743/Danielle-St-Amand-en-avance/1\"><b>Trois-RiviÃ¨res</b></a> put Danielle St-Amand back in front with 37.7% compared to 29.8% for the PQ&apos;s Djemila Benhabib and 26% for the CAQ. This is in contrast to a Segma poll from earlier in the campaign that gave the PQ a six-point lead and put the CAQ well out of the race. Again, the sample is small here so the lead St-Amand holds is not important.<br /><br />Nevertheless, these two polls show that the Liberals do have the ability to hold on to ridings where they are the incumbent. Whether these numbers will hold is another thing entirely, and in consideration of the small sample sizes we can only say that the Liberals are not out of the running in these two ridings.

More significantly, however, the poll indicated that the Coalition Avenier QuÃ©bec has moved into second, ahead of the governing Liberals. A poll this morning for <i>Le Soleil</i>&amp;nbsp;by Segma Recherche also points to Liberal woes, in this case in Quebec City.

QuÃ©bec Solidaire, with 6.8% support, is well behind the three frontrunners.<br /><br />The PQ is projected to win 67 seats, giving them four more than the bare minimum needed for a majority government. With 33 seats, the Liberals would form the Official Opposition while the CAQ would claim 24 seats and QS one.<br /><br />But this order of finish is far from certain. If an election were held today, the PQ could emerge with a minority or a majority, as the range puts them between 52 and 78 seats. Though the PQ&apos;s minimum ties with the Liberals&apos; maximum, it is extremely unlikely that the two parties would end up equal in seats.<br /><br />The Liberals should be more concerned with not finishing third, as the range puts them between 26 and 52 seats. That means they overlap with the CAQ&apos;s 12-32 seat range, and with FranÃ§ois Legault claiming a tiny bit of positive momentum to Jean Charest&apos;s negative trendlines, the odds are good that the CAQ could be in second place by the time the election rolls around.<br /><br />Regionally, the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois is leading in the Montreal suburbs (39.8% to the CAQ&apos;s 28.7% and the Liberals&apos; 20.9%) and in the eastern (43.9% to 25.7% for the PLQ) and western (38.8% to 25.8% for the Liberals and 24.2% for the CAQ) parts of the province.<br /><br />The Liberals only lead on the island of Montreal, though it is the widest lead in any region in Quebec. The Liberals have 46.2% support in the projection on the island, compared to 26.1% for the PQ and 13.6% for the CAQ.<br /><br />Legault&apos;s party, on the other hand, claims two leads. He is ahead in Quebec City with 36.5% support, trailed at length by the Liberals at 28.4% and the PQ at 25.1%. And in central Quebec, the CAQ is narrowly ahead with 33.2% to the PQ&apos;s 31% and the PLQ&apos;s 26.1%. It is a close three-way race, but the Liberals get the worst of it: the PQ is projected to win 10 seats in the region, with the CAQ winning nine and the Liberals only one.<br /><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mduVkn-J2j0/UDu1udeJAYI/AAAAAAAAKEw/BoWyuQ5f7W8/s1600/Leger.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"263\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mduVkn-J2j0/UDu1udeJAYI/AAAAAAAAKEw/BoWyuQ5f7W8/s400/Leger.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>The <a href=\"http://www.journaldemontreal.com/2012/08/25/pequiste-et-minoritaire\">LÃ©ger poll from Saturday</a> was eagerly awaited, as the only available set of numbers came in the form of the widely lampooned Forum Research poll.<br /><br />Rather than a big swing in favour of one party or another, LÃ©ger found things to be relatively stable since their poll of Aug. 13-16: the PQ unchanged at 33%, the CAQ up one to 28%, and the Liberals down one to 27%.<br /><br />Though the gap between the Liberals and the CAQ is well within the margin of error, making it impossible to claim with any certainty that the Liberals are in fact in third place, the psychological effect of that positioning could be catastrophic. If Legault and the CAQ appear to be the only real bulwark to the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois, the Liberals could shed federalist support over the next few days.<br /><br />While the gap between second and third was statistically insignificant, that between the PQ and the CAQ was not. The PQ also holds a significant lead among francophones with 38% (-2) to 31% (+2). The Liberals&apos; dominance among non-francophones remains unchallenged, however, with 67% support. The CAQ is down five points to 15% among this electorate.<br /><br />Though most movement was within the margin of error, some was noteworthy. QuÃ©bec Solidaire was up three points in the Montreal region to 9%, suggesting the performance of FranÃ§oise David in last Sunday&apos;s debate helped her party&apos;s fortunes. The CAQ was up eight big points in Quebec City to 46%, while the Liberals were up 11 on the island of Montreal to 45%.

Riding polls in the 2008 provincial election were also common. Ten ridings have been polled so far in this campaign.<br />The riding poll in Sherbrooke released in the second week of the campaign captured the most attention, as it put Jean Charest behind the PQ&apos;s Serge Cardin by 15 points. It certainly put a damper on the Liberal campaign, and is likely one of the reasons why Charest has visited his riding several times over the last few weeks. Those visits do not seem to have helped, as <a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/la-tribune/sherbrooke/201208/23/01-4567733-charest-peine-a-retrecir-lecart-dans-sherbrooke.php\">Segma Recherche was back in the field this week</a> and found that Charest still trails by double-digits.<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-f8OfLYZlAcQ/UDeWBsWYSII/AAAAAAAAJ-4/D7fJfST6PBA/s1600/Segma.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"275\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-f8OfLYZlAcQ/UDeWBsWYSII/AAAAAAAAJ-4/D7fJfST6PBA/s400/Segma.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>Segma was last in the field in Sherbrooke on August 6-8, and since then there has been very little change in the voting intentions of people in the riding.<br />Cardin is down one point to 45% while Charest is up two to 33%, insignificant amounts of change in a poll with a margin of error of +/- 4.3%. Despite the relatively high margin of error, however, Serge Cardin&apos;s lead is statistically significant.<br />The CAQ is down one point to 10% in the riding, while QuÃ©bec Solidaire is up one point to 7%. Option Nationale is up one to 3% and the Greens are unchanged at 2%, while the Parti indÃ©pendantiste&apos;s candidate sits at 1% support.<br />Riding polls have been off before, but this is a rather considerable gap between Serge Cardin and Jean Charest. The premier&apos;s chances are worsened by the fact that Segma has demonstrated consistent results over two polls. It could very well be that voters in Sherbrooke fully intend to oust Charest from office themselves, regardless of what happens in the rest of the province.<br /><a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/le-nouvelliste/elections-quebec-2012/201208/24/01-4567782-forte-avance-du-pq-dans-saint-maurice.php?utm_categorieinterne=trafficdrivers&amp;amp;utm_contenuinterne=cyberpresse_B4__2501_section_POS2\">Segma Recherche also polled the riding of Saint-Maurice for <i>Le Nouvelliste</i></a>, a riding somewhat up for grabs due to the retirement of the incumbent PQ MNA. Nevertheless, Luc Trudel of the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois is holding firm with 42%, virtually unchanged from the 43% the PQ took in 2008.<br />The Liberal candidate, Robert Pilotte, has 26% support (down 12 points from the last election) while Pierre GiguÃ¨re of the CAQ is at 22% (the ADQ took 15% in 2008).<br />They are followed at length by QuÃ©bec Solidaire (5%), and Option Nationale (2%). An independent candidate and the Parti unitÃ© nationale share 3% support.<br />The poll in Saint-Maurice is not surprising, as the PQ is the incumbent party and they are doing much better than the Liberals among francophones.&amp;nbsp;<br />But do these two polls suggest that the Forum poll from earlier this week might have been wrong-headed?<br />The current projection, which incorporates the results of the Forum poll, gives the PQ 38% in Sherbrooke with the Liberals trailing at 35%. It places QuÃ©bec Solidaire at 12% and the CAQ at 10%. The current projection in Saint-Maurice is 39% for the PQ, 33% for the PLQ, and 19% for the CAQ.<br />The projection, then, over-estimates Liberal support and under-estimates support for the PQ. If we remove Forum&apos;s poll from the equation entirely, the projection turns out to be much closer for both ridings. In Sherbrooke, it would instead be 43% PQ, 30% PLQ, 10% CAQ, and 7% QS. In Saint-Maurice, it would be 43% PQ, 28% PLQ, and 19% CAQ.<br />In other words, these two Segma riding polls seem to suggest that the surge in Liberal support recorded by Forum Research did not take place - or that it dissipated over the course of the three one-on-one debates. The projection for individual ridings has matched up to the results of Segma&apos;s polling quite well so far in this campaign. It could be coincidental that they do not match up so closely this time around, or it could be that the Forum poll was indeed off the mark. Undoubtedly, LÃ©ger Marketing and CROP will report in the next few days and clear the matter up.&amp;nbsp;<img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/623376556094758746-3748558677103626230?l=www.threehundredeight.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',1348689595,NULL,NULL,'Ã‰ric','http://www.blogger.com/profile/06849352443716808247','2012-08-24T11:17:00.000-04:00',NULL,'ThreeHundredEight.com',NULL,'Over the last few years, elections in Quebec have featured riding-level polling to a degree that is rarely seen in any other jurisdiction in Canada.

Those visits do not seem to have helped, as <a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/la-tribune/sherbrooke/201208/23/01-4567733-charest-peine-a-retrecir-lecart-dans-sherbrooke.php\">Segma Recherche was back in the field this week</a> and found that Charest still trails by double-digits.<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-f8OfLYZlAcQ/UDeWBsWYSII/AAAAAAAAJ-4/D7fJfST6PBA/s1600/Segma.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"275\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-f8OfLYZlAcQ/UDeWBsWYSII/AAAAAAAAJ-4/D7fJfST6PBA/s400/Segma.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>Segma was last in the field in Sherbrooke on August 6-8, and since then there has been very little change in the voting intentions of people in the riding.<br />Cardin is down one point to 45% while Charest is up two to 33%, insignificant amounts of change in a poll with a margin of error of +/- 4.3%. Despite the relatively high margin of error, however, Serge Cardin&apos;s lead is statistically significant.<br />The CAQ is down one point to 10% in the riding, while QuÃ©bec Solidaire is up one point to 7%. Option Nationale is up one to 3% and the Greens are unchanged at 2%, while the Parti indÃ©pendantiste&apos;s candidate sits at 1% support.<br />Riding polls have been off before, but this is a rather considerable gap between Serge Cardin and Jean Charest. The premier&apos;s chances are worsened by the fact that Segma has demonstrated consistent results over two polls. It could very well be that voters in Sherbrooke fully intend to oust Charest from office themselves, regardless of what happens in the rest of the province.<br /><a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/le-nouvelliste/elections-quebec-2012/201208/24/01-4567782-forte-avance-du-pq-dans-saint-maurice.php?utm_categorieinterne=trafficdrivers&amp;amp;utm_contenuinterne=cyberpresse_B4__2501_section_POS2\">Segma Recherche also polled the riding of Saint-Maurice for <i>Le Nouvelliste</i></a>, a riding somewhat up for grabs due to the retirement of the incumbent PQ MNA. Nevertheless, Luc Trudel of the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois is holding firm with 42%, virtually unchanged from the 43% the PQ took in 2008.<br />The Liberal candidate, Robert Pilotte, has 26% support (down 12 points from the last election) while Pierre GiguÃ¨re of the CAQ is at 22% (the ADQ took 15% in 2008).<br />They are followed at length by QuÃ©bec Solidaire (5%), and Option Nationale (2%). An independent candidate and the Parti unitÃ© nationale share 3% support.<br />The poll in Saint-Maurice is not surprising, as the PQ is the incumbent party and they are doing much better than the Liberals among francophones.&amp;nbsp;<br />But do these two polls suggest that the Forum poll from earlier this week might have been wrong-headed?<br />The current projection, which incorporates the results of the Forum poll, gives the PQ 38% in Sherbrooke with the Liberals trailing at 35%. It places QuÃ©bec Solidaire at 12% and the CAQ at 10%. The current projection in Saint-Maurice is 39% for the PQ, 33% for the PLQ, and 19% for the CAQ.<br />The projection, then, over-estimates Liberal support and under-estimates support for the PQ. If we remove Forum&apos;s poll from the equation entirely, the projection turns out to be much closer for both ridings. In Sherbrooke, it would instead be 43% PQ, 30% PLQ, 10% CAQ, and 7% QS. In Saint-Maurice, it would be 43% PQ, 28% PLQ, and 19% CAQ.<br />In other words, these two Segma riding polls seem to suggest that the surge in Liberal support recorded by Forum Research did not take place - or that it dissipated over the course of the three one-on-one debates. The projection for individual ridings has matched up to the results of Segma&apos;s polling quite well so far in this campaign. It could be coincidental that they do not match up so closely this time around, or it could be that the Forum poll was indeed off the mark. Undoubtedly, LÃ©ger Marketing and CROP will report in the next few days and clear the matter up.&amp;nbsp;<img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/623376556094758746-3748558677103626230?l=www.threehundredeight.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'News','News',NULL),(96,0,0,'Rogue poll or a turning of the tide for PLQ?','text/html','http://www.threehundredeight.com/2012/08/rogue-poll-or-turning-of-tide-for-plq.html','40th Quebec General Election;Canada',NULL,NULL,2,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-22 16:03:39',6,'So you might have heard that a new poll came out today.

QuÃ©bec Solidare picked up 1.8 points to hit 7.5%.<br /><br />With the Liberals now in front in the vote projection, they also move ahead in the seat projection. They picked up 20 seats to surge to 58, five short of a majority, while the PQ dropped 16 seats to 49. The CAQ dropped five seats to 16 and QuÃ©bec Solidaire increased their share from one to two.<br /><br />It goes without saying that the poll has injected a great deal of uncertainty into the projection, which now gives the Liberals and the PQ the possibility of forming a majority government or winning as few as 35 seats. In other words, because of this poll the projection model has no idea what would happen if an election took place today. This was the same sort of thing that occurred when Forum released their eleventh hour poll on the eve of the Alberta election, suggesting that a swing from Wildrose to the Progressive Conservatives was taking place. That a swing was underway turned out to be right, but it was the kind of swing that people were <i>expecting</i>&amp;nbsp;to happen in Alberta but never seemed to (at least in the last week of polls). This swing from the PQ to the Liberals is completely unexpected.<br /><br />For that reason, I don&apos;t want to get too much into the details of the new projection. If this is a rogue poll, it will swing back hard when LÃ©ger Marketing and CROP release their new numbers. If it isn&apos;t, and the two Quebec-based firms show the same Liberal surge in support, then we will know something is really going on.

The final debate between Pauline Marois and FranÃ§ois Legault, which takes place tonight, will be very important in deciding how the anti-Charest francophone vote will go. Marois has the advantage (even in Forum&apos;s poll), so the onus is on the CAQ leader to perform.<br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XDdOYshA7SA/UDU17aZq-vI/AAAAAAAAJ9Y/F1OfwlvTkkU/s1600/Forum.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"268\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XDdOYshA7SA/UDU17aZq-vI/AAAAAAAAJ9Y/F1OfwlvTkkU/s400/Forum.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>Forum was last in the field on August 13, and since then the Liberals increased their support by four points to lead with 35%.

At 1% they are not a big factor, but combined with the three points that QS gained we start to see where the PQ lost their six points.<br /><br />But the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois does still have an ace up their sleeve, as Forum found that 82% of their voters are very or somewhat enthusiastic about voting for the party. By contrast, enthusiasm sits at 72% among Liberals and 70% among CAQ voters. If that&apos;s a proxy for turnout, that transforms a six-point Liberal lead into a neck-and-neck race with the PQ.<br /><br />On the other hand, 48% of PQ supporters felt that FranÃ§oise David won the Sunday debate, compared to 23% who said Marois won it. CAQ voters were more split between David and Legault, while PLQ voters felt Charest won.

Djemila Benhabib, an author who lived in the Outaouais region and the target of Tremblay&apos;s comments, was also parachuted into the riding.<br /><br />Nevertheless, <a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/le-nouvelliste/elections-quebec-2012/201208/20/01-4566408-djemila-benhabib-en-tete-dans-trois-rivieres.php\">36% of voters in the riding say they will support her</a> (80% saying that Tremblay&apos;s comments have no influence on their vote). That gives her a six-point lead over Danielle St-Amand, the incumbent Liberal MNA. The CAQ trails with 18% while QuÃ©bec Solidaire is further behind with 8%.<br /><br />The projection currently has the PQ with 38% of the vote in the riding to 30% for the Liberals and 22% for the CAQ. While this shows the model is working well, it is also interesting that despite all of the local issues and controversies the riding is behaving generally as expected.<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k9aBxDhjk5s/UDOidRwqxFI/AAAAAAAAJ48/SRIuR1Z8oO0/s1600/NB.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k9aBxDhjk5s/UDOidRwqxFI/AAAAAAAAJ48/SRIuR1Z8oO0/s320/NB.PNG\" width=\"213\" /></a>Nicolet-BÃ©cancour was a bit of a mystery, though. The riding is where Jean-Martin Aussant, leader of Option Nationale and former PQ MNA, is running. The presence of an incumbent MNA from a new fringe party makes the riding very difficult to predict. How much of the PQ&apos;s vote would swing over to ON?<br /><br /><a href=\"http://tva.canoe.ca/stations/chem/nouvelle/20120820.html#175939\">The result</a> is a lead for the CAQ&apos;s Donald Martel with 30.6% of the vote, narrowly edging out Aussant&apos;s 27.7%. The PQ trails in third with 25.4% while the Liberals are well behind with 16.3%.<br /><br />The projection currently has the CAQ at 34%, the Liberals at 25%, the PQ at 22%, and ON at 18%, within the margin of error of the poll for the CAQ and PQ, while the ranges were wide enough to envision the poll&apos;s result for Aussant. That it pegged the CAQ as leading in the riding is a good sign, but figuring out the proportion of the vote that Aussant would be able to hold on to was always going to be difficult, as the model can only base itself on previous cases in other elections.

Djemila Benhabib, an author who lived in the Outaouais region and the target of Tremblay&apos;s comments, was also parachuted into the riding.<br /><br />Nevertheless, <a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/le-nouvelliste/elections-quebec-2012/201208/20/01-4566408-djemila-benhabib-en-tete-dans-trois-rivieres.php\">36% of voters in the riding say they will support her</a> (80% saying that Tremblay&apos;s comments have no influence on their vote). That gives her a six-point lead over Danielle St-Amand, the incumbent Liberal MNA. The CAQ trails with 18% while QuÃ©bec Solidaire is further behind with 8%.<br /><br />The projection currently has the PQ with 38% of the vote in the riding to 30% for the Liberals and 22% for the CAQ. While this shows the model is working well, it is also interesting that despite all of the local issues and controversies the riding is behaving generally as expected.<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k9aBxDhjk5s/UDOidRwqxFI/AAAAAAAAJ48/SRIuR1Z8oO0/s1600/NB.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k9aBxDhjk5s/UDOidRwqxFI/AAAAAAAAJ48/SRIuR1Z8oO0/s320/NB.PNG\" width=\"213\" /></a>Nicolet-BÃ©cancour was a bit of a mystery, though. The riding is where Jean-Martin Aussant, leader of Option Nationale and former PQ MNA, is running. The presence of an incumbent MNA from a new fringe party makes the riding very difficult to predict. How much of the PQ&apos;s vote would swing over to ON?<br /><br /><a href=\"http://tva.canoe.ca/stations/chem/nouvelle/20120820.html#175939\">The result</a> is a lead for the CAQ&apos;s Donald Martel with 30.6% of the vote, narrowly edging out Aussant&apos;s 27.7%. The PQ trails in third with 25.4% while the Liberals are well behind with 16.3%.<br /><br />The projection currently has the CAQ at 34%, the Liberals at 25%, the PQ at 22%, and ON at 18%, within the margin of error of the poll for the CAQ and PQ, while the ranges were wide enough to envision the poll&apos;s result for Aussant. That it pegged the CAQ as leading in the riding is a good sign, but figuring out the proportion of the vote that Aussant would be able to hold on to was always going to be difficult, as the model can only base itself on previous cases in other elections. The poll will be incorporated into the projection with the next update and will put Aussant within range of winning.<br /><br />A huge proportion of respondents (42%) were undecided, so the race in Nicolet-BÃ©cancour could go any which way.

They are down 0.2 points to 1.6%.<br />The seat ranges have moved significantly, with the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois capable of winning between 53 and 79 seats. As the Liberal range has dropped to between 24 and 51 seats, a Liberal plurality is no longer considered possible. Instead, they are now threatened by the CAQ for the role of Official Opposition, as the party could win between 14 and 32 seats. That is a bit of an overlap, and with the CAQ having the momentum and running much closer in the straight poll average, the odds are turning against the Liberals.<br />QuÃ©bec Solidaire dropped significantly on the island of Montreal, falling 3.9 points to only 8.1%. That puts them only a few ticks above their 2008 performance, and that is why the party is only projected to win one seat, and as few as none. The Liberals dropped 2.1 points to 36.4% and the PQ two points to 29.1%, while the CAQ made a big five point gain. They now sit at 18.7% and actually have three seats in range. That is primarily due to the divergent poll results increasing the volatility on the island, but it is something to keep an eye on.<br />In the suburbs around Montreal, the PQ dropped two points to 36.4% and six seats. The lion&apos;s share of the gains went to the Liberals, up 1.3 points to 28.7% and four seats. The CAQ was also up, gaining a point to reach 26.6%.<br />Quebec City saw a fair amount of change, as the LÃ©ger poll gave the CAQ a wide lead, rather than the Liberal lead that CROP identified. As a result, the CAQ picked up 3.6 points to reach 34.1%, and is up three seats to six. The Liberals dropped 5.6 points to 29.6% and five seats to only three, opening an opportunity for the PQ. The party only increased its support by 0.4 points to 26.4%, but gained a seat in the process.<br />In central Quebec, the PQ continues to lead with 33.6% (-0.3) but the Liberals fell 0.3 points to 28.4%, costing them one seat. The CAQ won it despite dropping 1.7 points to 27.5%. Notable is the 3.3-point gain by Option Nationale in the region. They currently have 4% support, just behind QuÃ©bec Solidaire. It is no coincidence that their best region of the province is also where Jean-Martin Aussant is running.<br />And in western Quebec, the CAQ picked up 3.6 points and one seat. They are still in third at 25.2%, but the gap has narrowed with the Liberals as they were down 2.8 points to 26.4%. The PQ, at 38.3%, still leads in the region.<br />Note that the projection model gives the Liberals (and the PQ) an organisational/turnout bonus, and this is why the party is still in second place in the Montreal suburbs and in eastern, central, and western Quebec. If we go just by the polls, however, the Liberals are in third in those regions.<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mBPTetdRflI/UC6QNDo1K0I/AAAAAAAAJy8/R1Ho9oHcDUo/s1600/Leger.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"260\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mBPTetdRflI/UC6QNDo1K0I/AAAAAAAAJy8/R1Ho9oHcDUo/s400/Leger.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>LÃ©ger was last in the field on Aug. 6-8, and since then the PQ has gained one point and has extended its lead over the Liberals.

The PQ is now projected to win between 50 and 75 seats, putting them in a very good position to come out ahead. The Liberals are projected to win between 30 and 54 seats, making a Liberal plurality highly unlikely.

On the island there have been no changes in seats, but the PQ is up three points to 30.2%. That still puts them well behind the Liberals, who lead with 42.3% (+0.7) in the projection, but the PQ is currently at their floor in terms of seats.

The Liberals are down 0.7 points and two seats to 28.3%, while the CAQ dropped 2.5 points to 25.8%, and two seats to only four.<br /><br />The PQ also made gains at both ends of the province, picking up 2.8 points in western Quebec and 3.2 points in eastern Quebec, in all giving them three more seats. In eastern Quebec, the PQ leads with 46.8% and is trailed by the Liberals at 29.3% (-2.8). The Liberals are down three seats, two of them going to the PQ and one to the CAQ, which is up 1.3 points to 18.1% in the region.<br /><br />In western Quebec, the PQ leads with 41.9% and is trailed by the Liberals at 28.1% (-1.8) and the CAQ at 21.8% (-1.8).<br /><br />The Liberals did improve their standing in Quebec City, however. They are up three points to 36.1%, widening the gap between them and the CAQ. FranÃ§ois Legault&apos;s party is up 0.8 points to 33.6%, but the Liberal gain has given them an extra seat. They are projected to win six to the CAQ&apos;s four and the PQ&apos;s one (they slipped 1.2 points to 23.3%).<br /><br />The CAQ also saw their fortunes improve in central Quebec, as the party picked up 3.7 points to hit 29% and six seats, a gain of one. The Liberals dropped 0.5 points to 29.4%, giving them a very narrow edge over the CAQ, but they also dropped one seat to only two. At 34.6%, the PQ leads (though they dropped 0.6 points).<br /><br />Worrisome for the Liberals is that they have fallen to third in the polls in certain regions. The projection adjusts polling results slightly, but in terms of the unadjusted average the PLQ now trails the CAQ for second place in central Quebec and the Montreal suburbs, and has fallen from first to second in Quebec City. The superior electoral machinery of the Liberals, however, should be able to make the difference.<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-chiZJ3EsM64/UCvo7c-L5rI/AAAAAAAAJp4/Piz_za6nhdA/s1600/Forum.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"272\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-chiZJ3EsM64/UCvo7c-L5rI/AAAAAAAAJp4/Piz_za6nhdA/s400/Forum.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/08/15/pq-extending-lead-over-charests-quebec-liberals-poll/\">Forum&apos;s latest poll for <i>The National Post</i></a>&amp;nbsp;generally shows the status quo from the polling firm&apos;s perspective, as no party has seen its support shift to a statistically significant degree. The PQ has widened their lead (and it is a lead just outside the margin of error) to four points, picking up one point to hit 35% while the Liberals dropped one to 31%. The CAQ slipped one point to 25%, while QuÃ©bec Solidaire was steady at 6%.<br /><br />None of the regional variations appear to be important, suggesting that voting intentions in the province are generally solid. The PQ holds a statistically significant lead on the south shore and among francophones, however, while the Liberals are well ahead among non-francophones.<br /><br />Even the approval/disapproval ratings of the leaders has not shifted more than a wink. If anything has occurred, however, it is that every leader has seen their disapproval ratings move up a tick or two.<br /><br />Forum includes a question on whether voters are enthusiastic or not to cast their ballot, a possible proxy for people who are likely to vote. There isn&apos;t a huge difference in voter enthusiasm between the parties, but the PQ does have the edge. If we look at the \"very enthusiastic\" totals, we get a vote share of 39% for the PQ, 31% for the Liberals, and 22% for the CAQ.<br /><br />Three riding polls have also been released over the last week, all by Segma Recherche. The first, for the riding of <b><a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/la-voix-de-lest/actualites/201208/10/01-4564211-francois-bonnardel-largement-en-avance.php\">Granby</a></b>, found the CAQ at 49% to 24% for the PQ and 16% for the Liberals. This was very close to the projection at the time, which gave the CAQ 49% to 23% for the PQ and Liberals.<br /><br />Two polls today in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region found the PQ in good standing, as the projection did. The PQ scored 59% in <b><a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/201208/15/01-4565207-les-pequistes-loin-devant.php?utm_categorieinterne=trafficdrivers&amp;amp;utm_contenuinterne=cyberpresse_B4_en-manchette_322_section_POS4\">Lac-Saint-Jean</a></b> and 53% in <b><a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/201208/15/01-4565207-les-pequistes-loin-devant.php?utm_categorieinterne=trafficdrivers&amp;amp;utm_contenuinterne=cyberpresse_B4_en-manchette_322_section_POS4\">Chicoutimi</a></b>, and were trailed by the Liberals and CAQ in a close tie for second. The Liberals had 21% in Chicoutimi and 17% in Lac-Saint-Jean, while the CAQ had 19% and 18%, respectively. The projection did give the PQ a wide margin of victory, but interestingly it was over-estimating Liberal support, mostly to the detriment of the CAQ.<br /><br />The Liberals were also over-estimated in Granby and Sherbrooke. This leads to two questions: is the projection over-estimating Liberal support? Or, are polls under-estimating their vote? If the projection is over-estimating the Liberals, this could have one of two consequences. On the one hand, it may be over-estimating the Liberal ability to win seats. On the other hand, it may be under-estimating Liberal support where they have incumbents. This occurred in the Alberta election, where the Liberal vote tanked disproportionately in ridings where they did not have an incumbent, and held firm in ridings where they did. There was no sign of that in the riding poll for Sherbrooke, though.<br /><br />But if the polls are under-estimating Liberal support we could see them be much stronger than expected on election night. This is what the projection model assumes with its adjustment mechanism for turnout, but there is always the possibility that the incumbency advantage will be especially strong in this election.<img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/623376556094758746-9197703785145004092?l=www.threehundredeight.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',1348689608,NULL,NULL,'Ã‰ric','http://www.blogger.com/profile/06849352443716808247','2012-08-15T14:50:00.000-04:00',NULL,'ThreeHundredEight.com',NULL,'One province-wide poll and three riding polls have been released since the last update, and for the first time in the campaign they put the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois in a position to form a slim majority government.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-K5mPNw8O81Q/UCvlXlsVbNI/AAAAAAAAJoY/gPrVxP21-Gs/s1600/Post.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-K5mPNw8O81Q/UCvlXlsVbNI/AAAAAAAAJoY/gPrVxP21-Gs/s320/Post.PNG\" width=\"155\" /></a>With a gain of 1.6 points, the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois is now projected to take 36.1% of the vote, giving them 65 seats.

The superior electoral machinery of the Liberals, however, should be able to make the difference.<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-chiZJ3EsM64/UCvo7c-L5rI/AAAAAAAAJp4/Piz_za6nhdA/s1600/Forum.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"272\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-chiZJ3EsM64/UCvo7c-L5rI/AAAAAAAAJp4/Piz_za6nhdA/s400/Forum.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/08/15/pq-extending-lead-over-charests-quebec-liberals-poll/\">Forum&apos;s latest poll for <i>The National Post</i></a>&amp;nbsp;generally shows the status quo from the polling firm&apos;s perspective, as no party has seen its support shift to a statistically significant degree. The PQ has widened their lead (and it is a lead just outside the margin of error) to four points, picking up one point to hit 35% while the Liberals dropped one to 31%. The CAQ slipped one point to 25%, while QuÃ©bec Solidaire was steady at 6%.<br /><br />None of the regional variations appear to be important, suggesting that voting intentions in the province are generally solid. The PQ holds a statistically significant lead on the south shore and among francophones, however, while the Liberals are well ahead among non-francophones.<br /><br />Even the approval/disapproval ratings of the leaders has not shifted more than a wink. If anything has occurred, however, it is that every leader has seen their disapproval ratings move up a tick or two.<br /><br />Forum includes a question on whether voters are enthusiastic or not to cast their ballot, a possible proxy for people who are likely to vote. There isn&apos;t a huge difference in voter enthusiasm between the parties, but the PQ does have the edge. If we look at the \"very enthusiastic\" totals, we get a vote share of 39% for the PQ, 31% for the Liberals, and 22% for the CAQ.<br /><br />Three riding polls have also been released over the last week, all by Segma Recherche. The first, for the riding of <b><a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/la-voix-de-lest/actualites/201208/10/01-4564211-francois-bonnardel-largement-en-avance.php\">Granby</a></b>, found the CAQ at 49% to 24% for the PQ and 16% for the Liberals. This was very close to the projection at the time, which gave the CAQ 49% to 23% for the PQ and Liberals.<br /><br />Two polls today in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region found the PQ in good standing, as the projection did. The PQ scored 59% in <b><a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/201208/15/01-4565207-les-pequistes-loin-devant.php?utm_categorieinterne=trafficdrivers&amp;amp;utm_contenuinterne=cyberpresse_B4_en-manchette_322_section_POS4\">Lac-Saint-Jean</a></b> and 53% in <b><a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/201208/15/01-4565207-les-pequistes-loin-devant.php?utm_categorieinterne=trafficdrivers&amp;amp;utm_contenuinterne=cyberpresse_B4_en-manchette_322_section_POS4\">Chicoutimi</a></b>, and were trailed by the Liberals and CAQ in a close tie for second. The Liberals had 21% in Chicoutimi and 17% in Lac-Saint-Jean, while the CAQ had 19% and 18%, respectively. The projection did give the PQ a wide margin of victory, but interestingly it was over-estimating Liberal support, mostly to the detriment of the CAQ.<br /><br />The Liberals were also over-estimated in Granby and Sherbrooke. This leads to two questions: is the projection over-estimating Liberal support? Or, are polls under-estimating their vote? If the projection is over-estimating the Liberals, this could have one of two consequences. On the one hand, it may be over-estimating the Liberal ability to win seats. On the other hand, it may be under-estimating Liberal support where they have incumbents. This occurred in the Alberta election, where the Liberal vote tanked disproportionately in ridings where they did not have an incumbent, and held firm in ridings where they did. There was no sign of that in the riding poll for Sherbrooke, though.<br /><br />But if the polls are under-estimating Liberal support we could see them be much stronger than expected on election night. This is what the projection model assumes with its adjustment mechanism for turnout, but there is always the possibility that the incumbency advantage will be especially strong in this election.<img

It does not discourage blood donation but, rather, aims to educate donors who are unaware of the policy.</p> <p>Arte argued that if sex is to be a conversation in blood donation, it should centre on safe sex practices, not an individual&apos;s sexual orientation.</p> <p>\"UMSU feels that the exclusion of men who have sex with men because of an assumed higher risk of HIV virus contamination is a homophobic practice especially when all blood, regardless of the sexuality of the donor, is tested,\" said Arte.</p> <p>Adrienne Silver, regional communications specialist at CBS, defended the policy by explaining that it was enacted based on scientific and domestic data, which showed that men who have sex with men were the population with the highest potential to spread the HIV virus.</p> <p>Silver said that these numbers are still similar today. In 2009 it was found that men who have sex with men made up 44 per cent of people who tested positive for HIV, three times higher than any at risk group of women.</p> <p>The policy states that any man who has had sex with another man since 1977 is ineligible for blood donations. According to Silver, 1977 is when scientists and the research community agree that HIV appeared.</p> <p>Silver admits that CBS is aware that the policy is outdated and that a change is needed.

It does not discourage blood donation but, rather, aims to educate donors who are unaware of the policy.</p> <p>Arte argued that if sex is to be a conversation in blood donation, it should centre on safe sex practices, not an individual&apos;s sexual orientation.</p> <p>\"UMSU feels that the exclusion of men who have sex with men because of an assumed higher risk of HIV virus contamination is a homophobic practice especially when all blood, regardless of the sexuality of the donor, is tested,\" said Arte.</p> <p>Adrienne Silver, regional communications specialist at CBS, defended the policy by explaining that it was enacted based on scientific and domestic data, which showed that men who have sex with men were the population with the highest potential to spread the HIV virus.</p> <p>Silver said that these numbers are still similar today. In 2009 it was found that men who have sex with men made up 44 per cent of people who tested positive for HIV, three times higher than any at risk group of women.</p> <p>The policy states that any man who has had sex with another man since 1977 is ineligible for blood donations. According to Silver, 1977 is when scientists and the research community agree that HIV appeared.</p> <p>Silver admits that CBS is aware that the policy is outdated and that a change is needed. This is why they are working on incremental change and plan to submit a proposal to Health Canada by the end of the calendar year. This proposal would revise the lifetime ban to a period of five years, meaning that only men who have had sex with men in the past five years would be ineligible.</p> <p>When asked why men could not donate if they have been tested and proven negative for HIV, Silver said that there remains a window period where someone can contract the virus without detection, putting the patient receiving blood at risk.</p> <p>Charly Wreggitt, U of M Womyn&apos;s Centre coordinator, stated that this ban also affects individuals who identify as women.</p> <p>Trans-women who have sex with men are ineligible as well as women who have sex with men that have previously had sex with other men.

The honour will be given to a pioneer of the folk community.</p> <hr /> <p><a href=\"http://thefulcrum.ca/2012/09/canadian-folk-music-strays-from-tradition/#.UGIapY7ZhzQ\"><strong>Click here for the original article from The Fulcrum</strong></a></p> <hr /> <p>\"The purpose is really to underline things that people are doing that set a new mould in the folk world,\" said Tamara Kater, executive director of Folk Music Canada.</p> <p>While folk music is usually described as traditional, Kater insists that it should not be considered stagnant.</p> <p>\"Even though folk is based on tradition, it&apos;s something that really comes from the people,\" she said. \"The music of the people never really stands still.\"</p> <p>It&apos;s sort of ironic, then, that the sector of music that&apos;s been given the \"traditional\" tag would reward innovation, while the majority of the mainstream music industry has fought tirelessly - and often illogically - against it. One might recall earlier this year when the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) sued LimeWire for $72 trillion, which is almost all the the money that exists in the world economy.</p> <p>Ridiculous claims like these are part of major labels&apos; vehement refusal to adapt to the age of technology and the free culture movement. But over at Folk Music Canada, the kind of innovative thinking that could straighten out the music industry - without trying to force a new generation of consumers to conform to an old school of business - might actually be rightfully rewarded.</p> <p>Unlike most music awards, the innovator award is not centred on the art form or on a musician&apos;s recordings. Instead, Folk Music Canada wishes to focus on the development of the folk community as a whole.</p> <p>\"What we&apos;re looking for is something that is new,\" said Kater. \"[This] can come from any aspect of the folk community. It could be an artist manager who found a new way of having management relationships with their artist, or it could be a festival that found a new way of operating, and who, for example, is not reliant on government grants.\"</p> <p>Ottawa, which just came off its 18th annual Folk Festival, has a thriving folk community. But, as far as innovation goes, it&apos;s hard to tell how the city fares.</p> <p>There are two main institutions that promote and celebrate folk music in Ottawa, other than the Ottawa Folk Festival.</p> <p>The Ottawa Folklore Centre, founded in 1976, acts as a hub for local talent and developing musicians by selling instruments, hosting events, and providing lessons for an array of unique instruments such as the Sri Lankan drum and the djembe. Spirit of Rasputin&apos;s, an event created in 2009 after a fire burned down the iconic Rasputin Folk CafÃ©, also provides opportunities for locals to showcase their talent.</p> <p>In 2010, these two organizations came together to create a series of \"folkcasts,\" an online concert series that could be accessed through YouTube or the Ottawa Folklore Centre <a href=\"http://www.ottawafolklore.com/ofc-spiritfolkcast/\">website</a>.</p> <p>These \"folkcasts\" are the kind of effort that could be nominated for the Folk Music Canada innovator award.

The honour will be given to a pioneer of the folk community.</p> <hr /> <p><a href=\"http://thefulcrum.ca/2012/09/canadian-folk-music-strays-from-tradition/#.UGIapY7ZhzQ\"><strong>Click here for the original article from The Fulcrum</strong></a></p> <hr /> <p>\"The purpose is really to underline things that people are doing that set a new mould in the folk world,\" said Tamara Kater, executive director of Folk Music Canada.</p> <p>While folk music is usually described as traditional, Kater insists that it should not be considered stagnant.</p> <p>\"Even though folk is based on tradition, it&apos;s something that really comes from the people,\" she said. \"The music of the people never really stands still.\"</p> <p>It&apos;s sort of ironic, then, that the sector of music that&apos;s been given the \"traditional\" tag would reward innovation, while the majority of the mainstream music industry has fought tirelessly - and often illogically - against it. One might recall earlier this year when the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) sued LimeWire for $72 trillion, which is almost all the the money that exists in the world economy.</p> <p>Ridiculous claims like these are part of major labels&apos; vehement refusal to adapt to the age of technology and the free culture movement. But over at Folk Music Canada, the kind of innovative thinking that could straighten out the music industry - without trying to force a new generation of consumers to conform to an old school of business - might actually be rightfully rewarded.</p> <p>Unlike most music awards, the innovator award is not centred on the art form or on a musician&apos;s recordings. Instead, Folk Music Canada wishes to focus on the development of the folk community as a whole.</p> <p>\"What we&apos;re looking for is something that is new,\" said Kater. \"[This] can come from any aspect of the folk community. It could be an artist manager who found a new way of having management relationships with their artist, or it could be a festival that found a new way of operating, and who, for example, is not reliant on government grants.\"</p> <p>Ottawa, which just came off its 18th annual Folk Festival, has a thriving folk community. But, as far as innovation goes, it&apos;s hard to tell how the city fares.</p> <p>There are two main institutions that promote and celebrate folk music in Ottawa, other than the Ottawa Folk Festival.</p> <p>The Ottawa Folklore Centre, founded in 1976, acts as a hub for local talent and developing musicians by selling instruments, hosting events, and providing lessons for an array of unique instruments such as the Sri Lankan drum and the djembe. Spirit of Rasputin&apos;s, an event created in 2009 after a fire burned down the iconic Rasputin Folk CafÃ©, also provides opportunities for locals to showcase their talent.</p> <p>In 2010, these two organizations came together to create a series of \"folkcasts,\" an online concert series that could be accessed through YouTube or the Ottawa Folklore Centre <a href=\"http://www.ottawafolklore.com/ofc-spiritfolkcast/\">website</a>.</p> <p>These \"folkcasts\" are the kind of effort that could be nominated for the Folk Music Canada innovator award. Unfortunately, they stopped being produced in 2011.</p> <p>Although not the focus of the award, musicians can also be nominated. Artists who have found new ways of approaching the music or who have created a new model for collaboration are examples of potential nominees.</p> <p>Vancouver-based singer-songwriter Dan Mangan, who played at this year&apos;s Ottawa Folk Festival, is a prime example of a Canadian musician who stands on the fringe of folk.

He will be the point person for all issues related to post-secondary education, according to Desjardins.</p> <p>\"It&apos;s very practical and there&apos;s only one person that we need to talk with now,\" she said.</p> <p>Staff within the Ministry of Education, Leisure and Sport said they have yet to receive directives from the PQ as to how responsibilities will be divided and reorganized between it and the new Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Technology.</p> <p>Desjardins said Duchesne attended the FEUQ&apos;s conference in August amidst the electoral campaign and met with some association members. She said that she spoke over the phone with Duchesne on Thursday and will be meeting with him next week so as to have enough time for both him to prepare and Desjardins to gather feedback from FEUQ members.</p> <p>The veteran PQ MNA Marie Malavoy will be the new Minister of Education, Leisure and Sport.</p> <p>According to Desjardins, Malavoy will not be involved in the settling outstanding issues related to the student strike or the organization of the upcoming summit on higher education, which the Premier has committed to organizing. Desjardins said the summit is likely to occur in February or March 2013.</p> <p>CLASSE executives have asked to schedule a meeting in the coming weeks with the PQ government to learn of the details around the summit.</p> <p><strong>Impacts on students</strong></p> <p>Though now abolished, the tuition increase was already billed to students attending Quebec universities.</p> <p>Circumstances vary depending on the institution: at the UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al tuition billing was delayed so no students will need reimbursement. At the UniversitÃ© du QuÃ©bec Ã  MontrÃ©al, the period to pay tuition ranges from mid-July to November 2 so the number of students affected is undetermined, whereas, at McGill University, the deadline for fall 2012 tuition payments was set for the end of August. At Concordia too, students were instructed to pay tuition including the hike weeks ago.</p> <p>Spokespeople from Concordia, McGill and UQAM confirmed that the universities have yet to receive any official direction from the government as to how and when reimbursements to students are to be provided.</p> <p>Possible options could include a direct refund or future credit for the next term, a spokesperson from UQAM explained, though she added no decisions had been made yet.</p> <p>-30-</p>\n   ',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'News','News',NULL),(168,0,0,'Laurier baseball allowed to play out season','text/html','http://cupwire.hotink.net/articles/53165','Canada',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,12,'\n<p><strong></strong></h2><p>Sports</strong></p><p><strong>Shelby Blackley - The Cord (Wilfrid Laurier University)</strong></p><p>WATERLOO (CUP) - After giving a presentation Sunday evening to athletic director Peter Baxter, interuniversity sport coordinator Wally Gabler, and vice president of Student Affairs David McMurray, the Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks men&apos;s baseball team was given the green light to continue the rest of their season.</p> <hr /> <p><a href=\"http://www.thecord.ca/?p=10816\"><strong>Click here for the original story from The Cord</strong></a></p> <hr /> <p>The Hawks were suspended last Thursday following a hazing incident that occurred at a rookie initiation party over the previous weekend.

Are you piling your plate with the building blocks your brain needs to function for academic success? Registered Holistic Nutritionist Kate Orlando gives students the skinny on turning your brain into a lean, mean, course-killing machine.</p> <p>If you think of your brain as a machine, Orlando says you can look at complex carbohydrates as the fuel that keeps it running. She recommends foods like whole grains, beans and lentils, which are slowly absorbed by your body and provide your brain with constant nourishment-as opposed to simple carbohydrates, which just give you intermittent bursts of fuel. Starchy vegetables like potatoes, yams, and carrots are another great example of complex carbs: think carrot sticks for an easy snack at school.</p> <p>Healthy fats are key to keeping your brain limber and well-oiled. These fats include omega-3 fats (found in flax seeds, hemp seeds, walnuts, and fish), omega-6 fats, and phospholipids, which are important for memory building. Phospholipids are found in good sources of cholesterol, which is why eggs are an excellent food option for students. Plus they&apos;re easy to hard-boil in advance and eat on your way out the door, or throw into a salad for lunch. But that&apos;s not all that&apos;s great about eggs: they&apos;re also a good source of protein, which leads me to amino acids.</p> <p>Amino acids are the building blocks of protein. Orlando calls these the \"brain messengers,\" and says that they improve brain communication and functions.

Orlando has advice for you too.</p> <p>\"Combining grains and legumes, like eating rice with beans or chickpeas with wheat berries, is a great way to make a complete protein for people who are vegan or vegetarian.\"</p> <p>Other protein-rich foods from non-animal sources include peas, broccoli, tofu, and nuts (raw and unsalted!).</p> <p>\"Intelligent nutrients,\" according to Orlando, \"are the minerals and vitamins that sort of fine-tune your brain.\"</p> <p>She explains that a diet rich in whole grains can get you most of the B-complex vitamins, and a plate full of dark, leafy greens (think kale, chard, or spinach lightly steamed) can give you the calcium and magnesium that your brain craves. Don&apos;t immediately reach for the milk to get your calcium: Orlando cautions that while milk isn&apos;t the worst thing to drink, milk contains only calcium.</p> <p>\"It&apos;s better to get calcium and magnesium together from a cleaner source like leafy greens,\" says Orlando, which is great advice for the vegans among us.

I was doing things I wouldn&apos;t have otherwise done.\"</p> <p>While her book delves into some of the problems she faced growing up, she also ran into issues in the publishing world. Getting the manuscript in front of a publisher proved to be problematic, since few accept unsolicited works. She had to fight to get an agent to represent her, and sent the book to eight different publishers, hoping for the best.</p> <p>That&apos;s when she turned to online publishing. As a graduate of the Vancouver Film School and still an avid filmmaker, Cousineau has many contacts in the entertainment industry. They were telling her to try to publish the book online, on her own. One of the first places she checked was Kindle.</p> <p>The online book giant has a self-publishing arm, something Cousineau thought she would try out.</p> <p>She submitted a manuscript, thinking it would again take a while to hear back. Less than two days later, her book was being distributed through the Kindle store.</p> <p>\"It was all kind of haphazard and fluky. It&apos;s what happens when anyone writes a book.\"</p> <p>A businessman in Australia loved it so much he helped her to pay for a small initial print of the book, which she is now touring with.</p> <p>With her first foray into the publishing world now behind her, Cousineau is already working on her next piece, a work of fiction.</p> <p>\"It&apos;s a way for me to write about the things I wanted to write about, without it having anything to do with me,\" she says with a laugh.</p> <p>-30</p>\n   ',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'News','News',NULL),(171,0,0,'The right types of tunes to study to','text/html','http://cupwire.hotink.net/articles/53159','Canada',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,12,'\n<p><strong></strong></h2><p>Arts</strong></p><p><strong>Mia Steinberg - The Martlet (University of Victoria)</strong></p><p>VICTORIA (CUP) - In the spirit of a new school year, here are the best types of studying music for your first assignment of the year.

Whether for doing well or doing good, it&apos;s always nice to be acknowledged. Yet although I&apos;m a firm believer in showing gratitude for acts of kindness, there is a difference between gratitude and adulation. There comes a point where my eyes cannot stop themselves from rolling. That point was crossed in the aftermath of an eight-year-old girl returning $4,000 to its rightful owner.</p> <hr /> <p><a href=\"http://theotherpress.ca/over-sung-heroes/\"><strong>Click here to read the original story from The Other Press</strong></a></p> <hr /> <p>I know what you&apos;re thinking: \"It&apos;s a little girl! Let her have her praise! It was very nice of her to return the money!\" The applause Abbie Jacobson of Maine received on her first day of school was adorable. Perhaps the front-page article detailing Abbie&apos;s good will and deep moral character was a bit over the top. The sold-out Justin Bieber concert tickets that were given to her by the Bank of Maine were definitely excessive.</p> <p>First off, the money wasn&apos;t hers, so she returned it to the rightful owner. This is not a novel concept. Why should people be rewarded for doing the decent thing? Granted, if I lost $4,000 and it was returned to me, I would learn to be more careful with my possessions - I might not be so lucky next time. Not everyone returns money that isn&apos;t theirs, but it&apos;s not so special that she did. There&apos;s no moral dilemma here: you either do the honest thing, or you don&apos;t.</p> <p>She did the honest thing. Let&apos;s move on with our lives.</p> <p>Not to say that kids are stupid, but they don&apos;t necessarily think to do something wrong. It may not even occur to them to keep something that isn&apos;t theirs. This isn&apos;t the sign of an ethical spine of steel. If someone refrains from doing me wrong because they&apos;re oblivious to other options, I don&apos;t think of them as the most moral peas in the pod. Besides, she&apos;s an eight-year-old kid: what&apos;s she going to do with $4,000?</p> <p>Now, a little side note on the Bank of Maine, which generously donated Justin Bieber tickets to Abbie and her family. John Everets, Chairman of the Board and CEO of the bank, after reading of Abbie&apos;s Bieber-love in the Portland Press Herald, reportedly said that this was \"a chance to do something nice for a beautiful little girl.\" More like it was a chance to get some much-needed good press.</p> <p>I&apos;d be more impressed by Everets if he were focused on improving the lives of those he serves, namely his banking customers. It&apos;s interesting that the Bank of Maine has chosen to do something nice for a little girl following a stint of bad press. They&apos;ve been in trouble for \"unsafe and unsound banking practices,\" and faced criticism from Occupy Maine protesters on their foreclosing of people&apos;s homes. Suddenly, their name is in the news for a reason other than unsafe banking practices - they&apos;ve diverted attention to a superficial act of supposed kindness, and now everyone loves the Bank of Maine.</p> <p>Trust me, I appreciate what Abbie Jacobson did, and I think it&apos;s wonderful if she&apos;s encouraged to be a good person. What I hate is this mind set whereby doing something decent gets you a massive, disproportionate reward.</p> <p>Abbie Jacobson&apos;s story, while sweet, distracts from the truly relevant matters. Too often we ignore those bigger issues in society, preferring to focus on superficial stories.

Yet although I&apos;m a firm believer in showing gratitude for acts of kindness, there is a difference between gratitude and adulation. There comes a point where my eyes cannot stop themselves from rolling. That point was crossed in the aftermath of an eight-year-old girl returning $4,000 to its rightful owner.</p> <hr /> <p><a href=\"http://theotherpress.ca/over-sung-heroes/\"><strong>Click here to read the original story from The Other Press</strong></a></p> <hr /> <p>I know what you&apos;re thinking: \"It&apos;s a little girl! Let her have her praise! It was very nice of her to return the money!\" The applause Abbie Jacobson of Maine received on her first day of school was adorable. Perhaps the front-page article detailing Abbie&apos;s good will and deep moral character was a bit over the top. The sold-out Justin Bieber concert tickets that were given to her by the Bank of Maine were definitely excessive.</p> <p>First off, the money wasn&apos;t hers, so she returned it to the rightful owner. This is not a novel concept. Why should people be rewarded for doing the decent thing? Granted, if I lost $4,000 and it was returned to me, I would learn to be more careful with my possessions - I might not be so lucky next time. Not everyone returns money that isn&apos;t theirs, but it&apos;s not so special that she did. There&apos;s no moral dilemma here: you either do the honest thing, or you don&apos;t.</p> <p>She did the honest thing. Let&apos;s move on with our lives.</p> <p>Not to say that kids are stupid, but they don&apos;t necessarily think to do something wrong. It may not even occur to them to keep something that isn&apos;t theirs. This isn&apos;t the sign of an ethical spine of steel. If someone refrains from doing me wrong because they&apos;re oblivious to other options, I don&apos;t think of them as the most moral peas in the pod. Besides, she&apos;s an eight-year-old kid: what&apos;s she going to do with $4,000?</p> <p>Now, a little side note on the Bank of Maine, which generously donated Justin Bieber tickets to Abbie and her family. John Everets, Chairman of the Board and CEO of the bank, after reading of Abbie&apos;s Bieber-love in the Portland Press Herald, reportedly said that this was \"a chance to do something nice for a beautiful little girl.\" More like it was a chance to get some much-needed good press.</p> <p>I&apos;d be more impressed by Everets if he were focused on improving the lives of those he serves, namely his banking customers. It&apos;s interesting that the Bank of Maine has chosen to do something nice for a little girl following a stint of bad press. They&apos;ve been in trouble for \"unsafe and unsound banking practices,\" and faced criticism from Occupy Maine protesters on their foreclosing of people&apos;s homes. Suddenly, their name is in the news for a reason other than unsafe banking practices - they&apos;ve diverted attention to a superficial act of supposed kindness, and now everyone loves the Bank of Maine.</p> <p>Trust me, I appreciate what Abbie Jacobson did, and I think it&apos;s wonderful if she&apos;s encouraged to be a good person. What I hate is this mind set whereby doing something decent gets you a massive, disproportionate reward.</p> <p>Abbie Jacobson&apos;s story, while sweet, distracts from the truly relevant matters. Too often we ignore those bigger issues in society, preferring to focus on superficial stories. I&apos;d rather ignore the little acts of decency that should be expected and focus on the important issues.</p> <p>-30-</p>\n   ',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'News','News',NULL),(176,0,0,'When tutoring becomes plagiarism','text/html','http://cupwire.hotink.net/articles/53155','Canada',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,12,'\n<p><strong></strong></h2><p>Opinion</strong></p><p><strong>Susan Currie - The Peak (Simon Fraser University)</strong></p><p>BURNABY (CUP) - I&apos;ve done a lot to sustain my addiction to higher education: I&apos;ve been a student caller, a maid, a cat sitter, a waitress and a security person in a big yellow coat.

People aren&apos;t in the position where they can pay up front or don&apos;t want to put themselves in a position of massive amounts of debt,\" said Marocchi.</p> <p>\"There is an entire demographic that will be less likely to acquire a post-secondary education.\"</p> <p>-30-</p>\n   ',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'News','News',NULL),(180,0,0,'Game Review: *Slender: The Eight Pages*','text/html','http://cupwire.hotink.net/articles/53152','Canada',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,12,'\n<p><strong>Horror game lives up to billing</strong></h2><p>Arts</strong></p><p><strong>Kevin Martin - The Nugget (Northern Alberta Institute of Technology)</strong></p><p>EDMONTON (CUP) - Most everyone has experienced a film, photo, or story that conjured up feelings of horror and aversion.

However, I only consider journalism to be my day job. While it&apos;s a pretty damn good day job, I am first a foremost a writer of fiction who only writes journalism as a means to make ends meet. It&apos;s a clichÃ©, but it pays the bills.</p> <hr /> <p><a href=\"http://ufvcascade.ca/2012/09/18/dont-quit-your-day-job-how-to-be-a-writer/\"><strong>Click here to read the original story from The Cascade</strong></a></p> <hr /> <p>It&apos;s not easy to get published these days. The days of prolific authors who made a living on writing fiction are all but gone. Today the big names are almost all postmodernist writers, such as Tao Lin, Chuck Palahniuk and Brett Easton Ellis.</p> <p>I&apos;ve had three short stories published, and nothing else. Only one of the magazines in which I&apos;ve been published in was remotely reputable - it was based out of Istanbul. I didn&apos;t get much money for my stories, and I don&apos;t have much to show for all the hard work. Of course, not all of us do it for the money. Although - money <em>is</em> nice. I like money. Don&apos;t you?</p> <p>Writers write because they love to - at least, real writers do. But when the story is over, and you want to publish it, you can&apos;t forget about how difficult it is to break into the industry.</p> <p>The American scene is even more impossible to break into as far as publishing goes. In order for a writer to be published there is a certain formula he or she needs to follow. First you write a short story that appeals to people - even if it sucks. Then you must send this story to around 100 literary magazines. Possibly more. Again, bear in mind your story probably sucks.</p> <p>Even if it&apos;s good, it doesn&apos;t matter. Publishers are overly cautious and usually reject you for the stupidest reasons. When the responses come back, wade through the rejection letters, rinse and repeat until a really lame literary rag accepts your shitty story. You probably won&apos;t get paid, so be prepared to live off of fingernails and black coffee for the first little while. Don&apos;t quit your day job.</p> <p>Repeat these steps, each time adding a publication to your resume of published stories, and then hope and pray that a slightly better literary magazine editor will take pity on your worthless subhuman writer soul and publish your next work.</p> <p>Well, maybe it&apos;s not as faceless and cruel as all that.

However, I only consider journalism to be my day job. While it&apos;s a pretty damn good day job, I am first a foremost a writer of fiction who only writes journalism as a means to make ends meet. It&apos;s a clichÃ©, but it pays the bills.</p> <hr /> <p><a href=\"http://ufvcascade.ca/2012/09/18/dont-quit-your-day-job-how-to-be-a-writer/\"><strong>Click here to read the original story from The Cascade</strong></a></p> <hr /> <p>It&apos;s not easy to get published these days. The days of prolific authors who made a living on writing fiction are all but gone. Today the big names are almost all postmodernist writers, such as Tao Lin, Chuck Palahniuk and Brett Easton Ellis.</p> <p>I&apos;ve had three short stories published, and nothing else. Only one of the magazines in which I&apos;ve been published in was remotely reputable - it was based out of Istanbul. I didn&apos;t get much money for my stories, and I don&apos;t have much to show for all the hard work. Of course, not all of us do it for the money. Although - money <em>is</em> nice. I like money. Don&apos;t you?</p> <p>Writers write because they love to - at least, real writers do. But when the story is over, and you want to publish it, you can&apos;t forget about how difficult it is to break into the industry.</p> <p>The American scene is even more impossible to break into as far as publishing goes. In order for a writer to be published there is a certain formula he or she needs to follow. First you write a short story that appeals to people - even if it sucks. Then you must send this story to around 100 literary magazines. Possibly more. Again, bear in mind your story probably sucks.</p> <p>Even if it&apos;s good, it doesn&apos;t matter. Publishers are overly cautious and usually reject you for the stupidest reasons. When the responses come back, wade through the rejection letters, rinse and repeat until a really lame literary rag accepts your shitty story. You probably won&apos;t get paid, so be prepared to live off of fingernails and black coffee for the first little while. Don&apos;t quit your day job.</p> <p>Repeat these steps, each time adding a publication to your resume of published stories, and then hope and pray that a slightly better literary magazine editor will take pity on your worthless subhuman writer soul and publish your next work.</p> <p>Well, maybe it&apos;s not as faceless and cruel as all that. But it&apos;s true that writers write so that readers can read. They&apos;re often not good at selling themselves. The publishing industry overlooks this. We&apos;re not all Don Draper.</p> <p>The Canadian writer W.P.

There are some things that have so far evaded both the body&apos;s natural resilience and years of man&apos;s mental ingenuity.\nSince 1981, and for a good number of years before its official recognition, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been one of the most evasive and widespread viruses in the world.</p> <hr /> <p><a href=\"http://martlet.ca/martlet/article/will-cure-hiv/\"><strong>Click here for the original story from The Martlet</strong></a></p> <hr /> <p>It has overwhelmed not only countless human bodies, but also the extent of humanity&apos;s combined medical capabilities. For years it has been believed that while we could manage HIV, maintaining a sort of rocky co-existence between the virus and our bodies, a cure would never be found.</p> <p>In 2009, Timothy Brown, along with his oncologist, Gero HÃ¼tter, demonstrated that life rarely presents us with absolutes. Brown - who for years was only known to the public by the moniker \"The Berlin Patient\" - became the first man in history to be declared cured of HIV.</p> <p><strong>Two threats, one treatment</strong></p> <p>Living in Berlin at the time, Seattle-born Timothy Brown contracted HIV in 1995. Fortunately, the advent of new anti-retroviral drugs in 1996 allowed people with HIV to live longer and healthier lives. Brown became used to this relatively healthy life until, in 2006, he developed a second life-threatening disease: leukemia.</p> <p>After an initial bout of chemotherapy, Brown&apos;s leukemia started to go into remission. However, when it returned in January 2007, it became clear that a stem-cell transplant was necessary.</p> <p>It was around this time that Brown&apos;s oncologist - a doctor who had no previous background in HIV medical research - made a suggestion that would eventually materialize into a possible cure for one of the world&apos;s most devastating diseases. A cure for one man, at least.</p> <p>HÃ¼tter had casually come across studies that showed the HIV virus attaches itself to a certain type of cells in our body called T-cells (cells that are responsible for fighting off diseases - immune system response cells). Many strains of the virus attach themselves to these cells via a certain type of receptor (called a CCR5 receptor), and use the cell to reproduce. When HIV takes over enough of these T-cells, the viral infection develops into AIDS and leaves the body fatally vulnerable to even the most placid illnesses, like the common flu.</p> <p>However, people with a particular genetic mutation that&apos;s present in about one per cent of the European population do not have the CCR5 receptor - the major co-receptor that HIV uses to infect the body. These lucky few have a natural resistance to HIV. In a flash of ingenuity, HÃ¼tter had the idea to take advantage of Brown&apos;s impending stem-cell transplant and use cells from someone with this HIV-resistant mutation.</p> <p>His ingenuity paid off - Brown stopped taking his HIV drugs the day of the transplant and never took them again. After repeated tests, an article was published in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, tentatively declaring Brown cured of HIV.</p> <p><strong>The Berlin Patient speaks</strong></p> <p>Brown says that he was initially reluctant to attempt the treatment.</p> <p>\"My initial thoughts were that I basically just wanted to be cured of the leukemia,\" says soft-spoken Brown, recalling the first time the experimental treatment came up. \"I thought it was a great idea, but I didn&apos;t really believe that it would work.\"</p> <p>At first, Brown turned down the stem-cell transplant option - stem-cell transplants are notoriously difficult on the body, and incredibly risky. When it became clear that there were no other options, Brown consented to receiving the transplant.<br/>\nBrown has not recovered completely from complications arising from the procedure, but he is both leukemia- and HIV-free. He still undergoes regular testing to ensure that the virus is not present in his body, and also gives regular blood samples to medical researchers across the United States.</p> <p>There is some controversy over whether or not Brown is completely rid of the virus. This past June at the International Workshop on HIV &amp; Hepatitis Virus in Spain, a San Francisco-based research group claimed that they had in fact detected very low levels of infected cells in samples they had collected from Brown. However, the report they published states that it is \"impossible to conclude\" that Brown remains infected. This, coupled with the fact that other labs have done similar tests with no results, and that the viral genes don&apos;t completely match samples of Brown&apos;s HIV before the transplant, suggest that the test results may be due to a sample contamination.</p> <p>Regardless of whether or not the findings are accurate, Brown is still considered functionally cured, meaning that even if some virus particles remain present, the virus is not actively replicating.</p> <p>Brown said after the conference that rumors that he is not cured (or even worse, that he has become re-infected) upset him, and have been difficult to read. Perhaps it was out of fear of episodes like this that for years Brown was reluctant to make his identity public.</p> <p>\"I did an interview in 2009 with a German newspaper . . . <em>Die Zeit</em>. When I did that interview, I asked them not to use my name,\" says Brown, who was still recovering physically and emotionally at that time, and at some points could not even walk or clean himself.</p> <p>\"I began to realize in 2010 that I needed to come out and be an advocate for other people to find a cure for HIV.\"</p> <p><strong>The Timothy Ray Brown Foundation</strong></p> <p>Since 2010, Brown has focused on being an activist for the cure of HIV. Brown&apos;s specific cure is not practical on a wide-range scale (due to its high risk, difficulty on the body, shortage of donors, cost and so on), but researchers are taking what they&apos;ve learned from Brown&apos;s case and are attempting to use that knowledge to work on more feasible cures. For instance, Brown mentions one attempt that focuses on removing HIV-susceptible receptors from T-cells without resorting to a transplant.</p> <p>At the International AIDS conference in Washington, D.C., in July, Brown announced his new foundation, the Timothy Ray Brown Foundation, which he started with assistance from the World AIDS Institute (a pre-established charity dedicated to documenting and preserving the history of the pandemic). Brown&apos;s organization is the only charity with the sole purpose of securing funds for cure research.</p> <p>Because modern-day anti-retroviral drugs are effective and improving all the time, and a cure for HIV was previously thought impossible, most research is geared towards improving these sorts of drugs. Studies have shown that improvements to these drugs have advanced to the point where the average life expectancy of those who receive an early diagnosis and proper treatment is only around seven years shorter than someone without the virus.</p> <p>Despite the significant increase in life expectancy since 1996, when anti-retrovirals were first released, both Brown and one of the co-founders of The World AIDS Institute, Chad Johnson, are adamant that one of the most important things to do for those living with HIV is not only to make sure they&apos;re looked after and have proper access to medical care, but also to work towards finding a cure.</p> <p>\"From my perspective, the way that we can really help people is that we can be investing a whole lot more resources into finding a cure,\" says Johnson, who has been involved in civil rights work for over 20 years and first partnered with Brown after a chance meeting at a conference. Johnson notes that although the United States government is planning to invest $2 to $3 billion into cure research in the next two years, it&apos;s not enough.</p> <p>\"We&apos;re really behind the game,\" says Johnson. \"Look at [Brown&apos;s] example and you can see there is a cure. If there is one person who can be cured, we can cure this thing. All we need is the right political and social will to make it happen. Our job is to make sure that hope is out there.\"</p> <p><strong>Spreading the cure</strong></p> <p>The possibility of finding a cure seems more likely all the time. At the International AIDS Conference this year, researchers from Harvard presented a report detailing the cases of two other patients who underwent a similar procedure to Brown. So far, no traces of the virus have been found in their blood samples. However, researchers maintain that it is still too soon to claim that they have been cured - both patients are still on anti-retroviral medication, and would need to go off the medication for a prolonged period of time to be sure that the virus is truly gone.</p> <p>The main difference is that while Brown&apos;s stem cells came from a donor with the CCR5 mutation, the two other patients&apos; donors did not. This demonstrates that even though the CCR5 mutation might have helped with Brown&apos;s cure, it may not be necessary to the procedure.</p> <p>Wherever this research leads, it has given people living with HIV hope for the future. Brown&apos;s best advice for those living with the virus? \"Don&apos;t give up hope, because a cure is on the horizon!\"</p> <p>Brown&apos;s story is one that documents both the unique ability of human ingenuity to step in and help cure the body when it is unable to cure itself, and the resilience of body and spirit. After surviving two life-threatening illnesses and narrowly escaping death several times, Brown&apos;s outlook remains positive.</p> <p>\"I joked to a friend of mine that I have nine lives, and he said I have at least a hundred,\" says Brown. \"I live my life as if I will live forever. Hopefully I will live for a long time.

But it wasn&apos;t easy. It took hard work; it took late nights; it took, you know, a very Stillwater-esque existential crisis (minus, presumably, the crashing plane, the confessions of homosexuality, the acid, etc.).</p> <p>\"There were a lot of really intense moments,\" says Ball. \"Moments where we didn&apos;t know what was going to happen, the thought of potentially breaking up, and yeah ... It was just kind of a roller-coaster ride making that album.\"</p> <p>The album, inspired by an eclectic mix of pop gods both old and new - Rhianna, Katy Perry, Michael Jackson, Fleetwood Mac and Paul Simon were all influences, says Ball - strives for a markedly \"classic pop\" feel, a genre shift that may or may not be at odds with the band&apos;s history and reputation as an indie outfit.</p> <p>\"On my part there was a lot of fear involved in going this more pop-y route and just going for it and getting over that and not being afraid. There&apos;s so many different ways you can take a song or that you could go as an artist. I think I was afraid of either letting our fans down, or letting myself down, or letting the guys down, or whoever it was ... We didn&apos;t want to feel like we were selling out or making something that wasn&apos;t truly us,\" says Ball.</p> <p>This trepidation, along with the challenge of working with a new producer, was what ultimately led to the band&apos;s very own Stillwater moment - a moment, Ball says, where they were struggling with who they were. In the end, it was an experience they came out the better for: it was only after the album was released that they were signed by Universal.</p> <p>Since the signing, they landed an esteemed gig playing at the Toronto International Film Festival alongside Yukon Blonde, Dan Mangan, Humans and PS I Love You, and are now on a cross-country tour.</p> <p>\"We want to keep it exciting, we want to keep people moving and interacting and dancing and, you know, crying maybe,\" Ball said with a laugh. \"Well maybe not - depending. But yeah, it&apos;s always really fun for us. I love performing for the audience.

But it wasn&apos;t easy. It took hard work; it took late nights; it took, you know, a very Stillwater-esque existential crisis (minus, presumably, the crashing plane, the confessions of homosexuality, the acid, etc.).</p> <p>\"There were a lot of really intense moments,\" says Ball. \"Moments where we didn&apos;t know what was going to happen, the thought of potentially breaking up, and yeah ... It was just kind of a roller-coaster ride making that album.\"</p> <p>The album, inspired by an eclectic mix of pop gods both old and new - Rhianna, Katy Perry, Michael Jackson, Fleetwood Mac and Paul Simon were all influences, says Ball - strives for a markedly \"classic pop\" feel, a genre shift that may or may not be at odds with the band&apos;s history and reputation as an indie outfit.</p> <p>\"On my part there was a lot of fear involved in going this more pop-y route and just going for it and getting over that and not being afraid. There&apos;s so many different ways you can take a song or that you could go as an artist. I think I was afraid of either letting our fans down, or letting myself down, or letting the guys down, or whoever it was ... We didn&apos;t want to feel like we were selling out or making something that wasn&apos;t truly us,\" says Ball.</p> <p>This trepidation, along with the challenge of working with a new producer, was what ultimately led to the band&apos;s very own Stillwater moment - a moment, Ball says, where they were struggling with who they were. In the end, it was an experience they came out the better for: it was only after the album was released that they were signed by Universal.</p> <p>Since the signing, they landed an esteemed gig playing at the Toronto International Film Festival alongside Yukon Blonde, Dan Mangan, Humans and PS I Love You, and are now on a cross-country tour.</p> <p>\"We want to keep it exciting, we want to keep people moving and interacting and dancing and, you know, crying maybe,\" Ball said with a laugh. \"Well maybe not - depending. But yeah, it&apos;s always really fun for us. I love performing for the audience. We like to have as much fun as we can out there and bring our best to each performance.\"</p> <p>As for the music they&apos;ll be playing, you needn&apos;t look further than the album&apos;s title, <em>IS</em>.</p> <p>\"It represents the three of us - not too pushy and just kind of is . . .

Students, sponsors, faculty, friends, family and everyone else were really excited,\" Dutchak said.</p> <p>The club got such a positive response that they decided the best way to promote the rebirth of the campus club would be to host a rodeo and invite colleges and technical institutions to compete in it.</p> <p>After gaining membership in the Canadian Intercollegiate Rodeo Association, the U of S invited fellow CIRA members Lakeland and Olds College to the rodeo.</p> <p>Once both schools confirmed their attendance, Clemens and Dutchak set a date for the inaugural event.</p> <p>The first annual U of S rodeo will take place Sept. 22 at the OK Corral in Martensville, Sask.</p> <p>The rodeo will include ten events highlighted by the bull riding, barrel racing, pole bending, goat tying, and breakaway roping.

No one knew what to expect from the Spartans, or of any of the teams in the tournament for that matter.</p> <p>The Spartans were at a bit of a disadvantage from the get-go because the other teams in the tournament had mostly older players, including some who already had experience playing professionally.</p> <p>Whatever the disadvantages, real or perceived, the Spartans showed very encouraging signs that the team is ready for big things this season. The Spartans got off on the wrong foot with a loss to the Dominican Republic which saw the Dominicana win every set by at least five points.</p> <p>The Spartans bounced back with another loss, but put forth a tremendous fight against the host Peru, which saw the Spartans improve steadily after a disappointing first set.</p> <p>They had their chances, particularly in the third set when extra points were needed, but ultimately came up short.</p> <p>The women then came back with their best performance of the tournament by absolutely boat-racing Costa Rica 25-16, 25-15, 25-18 and out-killing the opponent 32-19. The win ensured the Spartans would qualify for the quarter-finals and finish third in their pool.</p> <p>The team suffered a setback in the quarter-finals lasting a little more than an hour in a straight-set loss to a very good Argentinian team.

The Spartans got off on the wrong foot with a loss to the Dominican Republic which saw the Dominicana win every set by at least five points.</p> <p>The Spartans bounced back with another loss, but put forth a tremendous fight against the host Peru, which saw the Spartans improve steadily after a disappointing first set.</p> <p>They had their chances, particularly in the third set when extra points were needed, but ultimately came up short.</p> <p>The women then came back with their best performance of the tournament by absolutely boat-racing Costa Rica 25-16, 25-15, 25-18 and out-killing the opponent 32-19. The win ensured the Spartans would qualify for the quarter-finals and finish third in their pool.</p> <p>The team suffered a setback in the quarter-finals lasting a little more than an hour in a straight-set loss to a very good Argentinian team.

For Kurisu, it&apos;s the competitive element, and Schnell relishes \"the physical challenges of the game: it&apos;s either you or him, someone&apos;s going to win and someone&apos;s going to lose.\"</p> <p>But the greatest feeling for them all? \"There&apos;s nothing better than when it just comes down to pure man-on-man battle,\" said Schnell.</p> <p>They love what they do and they&apos;re perfectly happy staying out of the limelight by giving each other the recognition they deserve. Together, they truly define teamwork and passion for the sport.</p> <p>-30-</p>\n   ',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'News','News',NULL),(202,0,0,'History beckons Lancers women&apos;s basketball','text/html','http://cupwire.hotink.net/articles/53092','Canada',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,12,'\n<p><strong></strong></h2><p>Sports</strong></p><p><strong>Kim Elliot - The Lance (University of Windsor)</strong></p><p>WINDSOR (CUP) - Despite the lure of being the third women&apos;s basketball program in the history of the CIS to &apos;three-peat&apos; as national champions, it&apos;s back to the basics for the Lancers.</p> <hr /> <p><a href=\"http://uwindsorlance.ca/2012/09/13/history-beckons-womens-basketball/\"><strong>Click here for the original story from the Lance</strong></a></p> <hr /> <p>\"We may be even more talented this year,\" head coach Chantal VallÃ©e said of her 2012-2013 squad. \"But we haven&apos;t won anything together.\"</p> <p>Although Coach VallÃ©e believes this year&apos;s recruit class will compensate for the talent deficit left by the graduation of guard Emily Abbott and forward Iva Peklova.

The university had to do it,\" said Filion.</p> <p>UdeM&apos;s student newspaper <a href=\"http://quartierlibre.ca/la-securite-fait-sa-loi/\"><em>Quartier Libre</em> reported</a> that the head of the university&apos;s security services Lucie Dupuis approached at least one anthropology professor, who&apos;s class was being blocked by picket lines, and told the professor to continue teaching her class in lieu of Law 12.</p> <p>According to the <em>Quartier Libre</em>, the professor had attempted to mediate the situation before calling the director of her program. Security agents and a mediation team from the Montreal police force came to the classroom and allegedly threatened demonstrators with criminal charges.</p> <p>Filion said the university&apos;s decision to call police onto campus was a difficult one to make. \"We didn&apos;t call the police with joy,\" he said, going on to say that the decision was one made in the moment.</p> <p>According to president of UdeM&apos;s union for professors, Jean Portugais, at least one professor pushed by the police is looking to file a complaint. He added that many professors were panicked by the situation and unable to teach their classes in a work environment he deemed \"unacceptable\" due to the presence of police.</p> <p>\"It&apos;s like we&apos;re flies, that&apos;s the image it creates,\" he said, pointing to the number of police compared to student demonstrators.</p> <p>FrÃ©dÃ©ric Kantorowski, current president of the union representing course lecturers at UdeM, <a href=\"http://quartierlibre.ca/charges-de-cours-rapports-chaotiques-avec-la-direction/\">told the <em>Quartier Libre</em></a> that the university&apos;s directives throughout the intervention varied depending on the employee.</p> <p>\"Several course lecturers came forward with complaints against the police and UdeM security agents,\" he said. \"Some were even in tears after being mistreated or threatened.\"</p> <p>\"That security [agents] at UdeM were given the role of police was excessive,\" he added.</p> <p>The mandated return to class under Law 12 raised widespread concerns within Quebec universities of the role of university security services would assume in policing staff and students.</p> <p>At the UniversitÃ© du QuÃ©bec en Outaouais in Gatineau, <a href=\"http://profscontrelahausse.org/category/communiques/\">the professors&apos; union sought to contest the installation of security cameras</a> in the hallways of some professors&apos; offices as an attack on its members&apos; privacy and a violation of the right to fair and reasonable working conditions.</p> <p>Days before the UniversitÃ© du QuÃ©bec Ã  MontrÃ©al&apos;s disrupted winter 2012 semester was to recommence, <a href=\"http://www.ledevoir.com/societe/education/357640/les-professeurs-de-l-uqam-sont-prets-a-defier-la-loi-speciale\">UQAM&apos;s professors&apos; union voted by secret ballot</a> to support its members&apos; decision to break Law 12 and refuse to teach classes if the professors judge conditions unfit to teach in.</p> <p><strong>Temporary security agents</strong></p> <p>The August police interventions at UdeM were <a href=\"http://quartierlibre.ca/tension-sur-le-campus/\">not the first time concerns with the actions of the university&apos;s security services have been raised</a>.</p> <p>In April, the university brought additional security agents onto campus from the private security agency BEST. UdeM typically employs security personnel from the agency Garda.</p> <p>The additional agents were to assist enforcing an injunction brought against student strikers that aimed to allow for the resumption of classes.</p> <p>As the strike continued, allegations of racism, sexism and intimidation towards teaching staff and students by the security agents began to surface. Filion said that the situation in April affected how UdeM hired temporary supplementary security agents for the month of August.</p> <p>Classes for UdeM&apos;s winter 2012 semester, with the exception of eight courses unable to continue due to concerns of the quality of instruction, resumed September 5 and run until September 28. The fall 2012 term will begin on October 2.</p> <p><strong>English campuses</strong></p> <p>Incidents preceding Law 12 within Montreal&apos;s English-language universities has brought the nature and roles of campus security services to the forefront as well.</p> <p>At McGill University, campus security <a href=\"http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2012/02/private-security-in-a-public-university/\">came under scrutiny</a> due to their involvement in the university&apos;s semester-long strike of non-academic workers and the presence of riot police on campus in November 2011.</p> <p>At Concordia University, the alleged assault of a McGill student by a security agent while she was picketing classes last March <a href=\"http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/2917\">prompted scrutiny</a> over how Concordia&apos;s security services operates.</p> <p>-30-</p>\n   ',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'News','News',NULL),(205,0,0,'Sudoku for September 17, 2012','text/html','http://cupwire.hotink.net/articles/53090','Canada',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,12,'\n<p><strong></strong></h2>   ',1348774481,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Tue, 18 Sep 2012 03:22:00 -0400',NULL,'Canadian University Press newswire RSS feed',NULL,'\n<p><strong></strong></h2>   ',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'News','News',NULL),(206,0,0,'B.C. planning ahead for aboriginal post-secondary education','text/html','http://cupwire.hotink.net/articles/53080','Canada',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,12,'\n<p><strong></strong></h2><p>News</strong></p><p><strong>Micki Cowan -Â CUP B.C.

That&#8217;s been the Globe&#8217;s defence, and people are buying it: gosh, it only happened once. Please, don&#8217;t help them. Media Culpa&#8217;s allegation is specifically that itÂ <strong>didn&#8217;t</strong> happen just once.

I could go on, but I think you get the picture.</p>\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s recap. After the issue finally went big-time, the Globe &amp; Mail&#8217;s public editorÂ <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/community/inside-the-globe/public-editor-we-investigate-all-complaints-against-our-writers/article4559295/\">issued a general denial</a> saying plagiarism was &#8220;highly unlikely&#8221; and foisting it all off on &#8220;an anonymous blogger.&#8221; (In a fine show of attribution ethics, the Globe seems to be minimizing any possible reference, let alone linking, to Media Culpa herself.) That evidently wasn&#8217;t enough, so a vague statement that Wente had been &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/globe-takes-action-on-allegations-against-columnist-margaret-wente/article4565683/\">disciplined</a>&#8221; was released. That didn&#8217;t work either, so Wente wrote her own <a href=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6594\">paranoid semi-apology</a> claiming she was being targeted by political opponents. Then the editor-in-chief published an <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/editor-in-chief-john-stackhouses-memo-to-globe-and-mail-staff-on-margaret-wente-allegations/article4565665/\">open letter to his staff</a> (oh, barf) announcing that in the future the public editor would be reporting directly to the publisher in the future (great, I&#8217;m sure that will solve everything).</p>\n<p>Finally the public editor &#8212; whom I will not be naming, out of respect for her own apparent dislike of naming the blogs <em>she</em> is referring to &#8212; produced another piece, probably the most appalling of all, consisting of a series of recommendations to Globe staff, to editors, and lastly to herself. Honestly. After more than a century of leading the Canadian media, it&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/community/inside-the-globe/public-editor-what-we-need-to-do-better/article4566275/\">come to this at the Globe &amp; Mail</a>:</p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote><p>Don&apos;t ever cut and paste someone else&apos;s words and work over or around them. Only cut and paste something you intend to directly quote and attribute.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Really? Globe staff need to be <em>told</em> this? What do you people do in journalism school, anyways? Surely this must have come up at <em>some</em> point in your collective education. Interestingly, the dishonoured Ms. Wente&#8217;s alma mater, the University of Toronto, now has an entire Web page called &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.writing.utoronto.ca/advice/using-sources/how-not-to-plagiarize\">how not to plagiarize</a>.&#8221; It&#8217;s geared towards young students, mostly because the pampered academics at U of T were apparently under the mistaken impression that by the time their graduates were hired on by newspapers they wouldn&#8217;t need to take a refresher course in how to use the quotation mark key.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s at this point, though, that I want to return to the rest of the media. I cannot believe that anyone who doesn&#8217;t have a direct stake in the Globe &amp; Mail is still defending this cock-up, and we&#8217;re getting well past the point where coming out in Wente&#8217;s defence has to be seen as a mark of suspicion against the person making the defence. Particularly when I read <a href=\"http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/09/24/margaret-wente-remix-artist/\">something like this</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Everyone is expected to maintain the same standards while working with a fraction of the resources. That&apos;s simply impossible, and the fact that sloppy work sees print is an inevitable result&#8230;</p>\n<p>This is a silly technicality worth reconsidering in the Internet age. As an \"idea synthesizer\" myself, I regularly hop about from site to site, grabbing a topic here, an example there&#8230; Like many things these days, it comes down to a generational divide in how we feel about copying.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s Jesse Brown of <em>Maclean&#8217;s</em>, offering various reasons, none of them good ones, for why a professional reporter might find themselves accused of plagiarism. But even that piece of fluff, complete with its absurd complaints about plagiarism being an obsolete relic of a bygone age, pales next to <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1262116--tim-harper-the-perils-of-mainstream-journalism-in-the-social-media-era\">a truly awful piece of piffle</a> by Tim Harper of the Toronto Star:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I felt a pang in my gut and I challenge anyone who does this for a living to tell me there wasn&apos;t a slight shiver of \"there but for the grace of God . . .\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>Really? Truly? Has the Canadian journalism profession sunk so low that <em>everyone</em> is possibly guilty of plagiarism? I find that hard to believe, and yet&#8230; should we be searching through the work of other columnists, too, for anything that the, um, &#8220;grace of God&#8221; hasn&#8217;t been able to conceal?</p>\n<p>Harper then launches himself off on a patronizing and irrelevant stream of nonsense about how he might one day find himself accused of plagiarism for vaguely referring to an idea that came up in conversation once with a businessman, or if he happens to remember some words from an old book, or some such. Well, Tim, if your memory is so precise that you can remember whole sentences word for word but so poor that you can&#8217;t remember where the sentence came from, then yes, I suppose thatwould be an excuse for plagiarism. It doesn&#8217;t sound like an awfully convincing one, though, does it?</p>\n<p>In any event, it&#8217;s also irrelevant, so irrelevant that I have to think that either Tim didn&#8217;t bother to read up on the Wente allegations the way he claims he did, or that he&#8217;s for some reason decided to lend a hand to the Globe editors in their attempt to whitewash the whole sorry affair. We&#8217;re not talking about a few scraps of information that floated into Wente&#8217;s head one time. We&#8217;re talking about substantive sentences, lifted from multiple sources, in multiple columns.</p>\n<p>This country has real issues to worry about. In the last year alone, we have been presented with documented evidence of large-scale electoral fraud, our environmental protection and climate change regimes have been ripped to shreds, and the federal government has laid aside the Canada Health Act and thus ended, at least in principle, universal healthcare. More evidence continues to emerge that it plotted a systematic course of deception with regard to the cost of a multi-billion dollar military procurement project. And our media is so breathtakingly incompetent that they can&#8217;t even agree on whether someone in their ranks was copying and pasting without attribution and, if so, whether it was very wrong of them to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> The National Post has now published a defense-of-Wente column too, an <a href=\"http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/09/26/dan-delmar-self-righteous-sinners-cast-the-first-stone-at-margaret-wente/\">odious piece of work</a> which suggests that this was a single inadvertent lapse of judgement on Wente&#8217;s part, a conclusion so at odds with the evidence presented at Media Culpa that I can only assume this is yet one more pundit who didn&#8217;t even bother reading the allegations before shooting his mouth off about them.

Regular readers will know that I <a href=\"http://sixthestate.net/?tag=margaret-wente\">despise Margaret Wente</a>. The disgust only deepened a couple weeks ago when, after months of tirades against pampered low-tuition arts students, she published a bizarre memorial to her own low-tuition university arts experience in &#8220;the 60s&#8221; (barely, since she was born in 1950), back when professors sleeping with students was A-okay (and something which dear old Maggie herself apparently finds &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/margaret-wente-what-i-learned-at-university/article4527764/\">intensely erotic</a>&#8220;).</p>\n<p>Second, a <a href=\"http://mediaculpapost.blogspot.ca/\">Media Culpa</a>. This anonymous blogger &#8212; I actually do know her name, as do many people now, but the blog is signed anonymously and I will respect that convention &#8212; has done yeoman&#8217;s work for years now, painstakingly compiling evidence that high-profile Globe columnist Margaret Wente is a plagiarist. A serial plagiarist, at that. For some reason, following an epic campaign on Twitter a while ago, this work broke out into the open. (Although anyone with a keyboard and an Internet connection could have been reading it for months&#8230;) The Globe&#8217;s public editor published a truly horrendous defence of Wente, cavalierly dismissing the allegations as the &#8220;unlikely&#8221; ramblings of an anonymous blogger. You can read what happened next in the <a href=\"http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/09/24/chris-selley-on-margaret-wente-plagiarism-and-the-globes-public-editor-cum-union-rep/\">National Post</a> and <a href=\"http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/09/23/globe-and-mail-or-cut-and-paste/\">Maclean&#8217;s</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, then. Wente has been trotted out to <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/columnist-margaret-wente-defends-herself/article4565731/\">issue her own apology</a>, and it&#8217;s pretty much as arrogant and pathetic as I&#8217;ve come to expect from Wente. She makes the following argument:</p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote><p>A blogger has accused me of substantively plagiarizing the column, and much else. I&apos;m not a serial plagiarist. What I often am is a target for people who don&apos;t like what I write.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think she&#8217;s confusing her bloggers here. <em>I&#8217;m</em> the one (one of the many, anyhow) who target her because we don&#8217;t like what she writes. We don&#8217;t like it, for instance, when she further tarnishes the already tattered reputation of Canada&#8217;s paper of record with bullshit columns arguing that natural resources are infinite, that <a href=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=3031\">poor people are actually rich</a>, and that we&#8217;re better off being <a href=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=2923\"><em>deliberately</em> unreasonably optimistic</a> when discussing the world&#8217;s problems. Among many, many other things.</p>\n<p>Media Culpa, on the other hand, isn&#8217;t concerned with what you wrote, but how you wrote it. You plagiarized. The list of allegations on that website is extensive and, contrary to Ms. Wente&#8217;s apology column, isn&#8217;t limited to one instance where she stole considerable material from another Canadian columnist, Dan Gardner. By Wente&#8217;s own public statements, plagiarism is wrong. Now Wente would have us believe that she plagiarized just this once, and all by accident. I suspect this is the defence made by a large majority of plagiarists, though I really wouldn&#8217;t know.</p>\n<p>With that out of the way, dear old Maggie veers sharply off track into a perverse attack on Media Culpa, and this is the part where I want to focus my own concerns. Media Culpa, Wente says, is an &#8220;obsessive&#8221; Ottawa professor. And it&#8217;s too bad, she signs off, that we &#8220;live in an age where attacks on people&#8217;s character and reputation seem to have become the norm.&#8221; The whole thing is nauseating. As usual, confronted with a legitimate criticism by the blogging community, the professional response is to yawn and say, &#8220;Yeah, so what? We get paid for this, losers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Still, on that last point, Wente is right, in a backhanded sort of way. In her case the criticism is well deserved: she got caught plagiarizing. But this &#8220;persecuted by the modern age&#8221; tripe plays to a more disturbing audience. A while ago, a <a href=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6316\">Sun reporter published a piece</a> attacking the fact that Sixth Estate was anonymous. To have credibility, he claimed, you needed to have your name on your work, and you needed to identify your sources (although in that story, I didn&#8217;t actually <em>have</em> any non-public sources to mention, but whatever).</p>\n<p>Which is fine, if you&#8217;re being paid to give your opinions professionally. I&#8217;m not. The rest of us have to deal with the real world, and when the real world gets stirred up by people with persecution complexes, like Wente, the reality isn&#8217;t always pretty. Here, for instance, is one of the responses to Wente&#8217;s column:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Professor Wainio is a campus radical, best described as a champion of the Campus Thought Police, HRC commissariat, and the Campus Diversity Industry. She is a militant&#8230;</p>\n<p>There is some sort of university affiliation behind Ms Waino&#8217;s name; students on that campus ought to scrutinize her activities carefully and report what they see to their administration.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The fact that Wainio is a professor, possibly a tenured professor, gives her a bit of a shield against wackiness. Almost as good as being a professional journalist, you might say. But still. Seriously?</p>\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6594\" data-text=\"Wanted: One Plagiarist. 20+ Years Experience in Print Media an Asset.\" data-count=\"horizontal\">Tweet</a>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'Opinion','News',NULL),(290,0,0,'Conservative Government Abandons Market Principles on Climate Change File','text/html','http://sixthestate.net/?p=6580','Environment and Energy;Canada',NULL,NULL,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,14,'Years ago now, the big argument in the climate change community was about how to lower emissions.

Vaguely progressive parties, like the NDP, moved towards market solutions <strong>specifically</strong> because right-wing political marties and free-market think tanks insisted that regulation came from the devil. Now that the NDP have come onboard, the Conservatives announce a sudden <em>volte-face</em> and argue that big government, not the market, will solve environmental problems.</p>\n<p>Now, I just want to pause here and repeat that statement again, so it can really sink in: <strong>the Conservatives claim that big government, not markets and innovation, will solve environmental problems</strong>.</p>\n<p>I think as Canadians we are owed an explanation as to why the party of the free market has suddenly decided that regulation is preferable to market incentives. I think Conservative voters, in particular, should be very interested in learning why such a central principle of the political party is being thrown away. The media should be particularly strident in asking such questions.</p>\n<p>Of course, I doubt many hard questions will actually be asked. After all, we all know what the real reason here is: Peter Kent&#8217;s regulations are horseshit. They will be loose enough that they will require virtually no adjustment in the business sector at all. And of course, cap-and-trade may be cheaper to business than strong regulations, but virtually no regulations are the best alternative of all.</p>\n<p>And the climate? Fuck it. Here&#8217;s the coming spin: Once the sea level rises high enough for me to kayak from the suburbs to my office in downtown Vancouver, I can ditch my car and reduce carbon emissions.

The National Post is Canada&#8217;s climate change denialist mediaÂ <em>par excellence</em>. Their columnists host an annual Junk Science Week, dedicated to junking real science, especially climate change. The irony in the Higgs boson case was bad enough. But <a href=\"http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/09/19/matt-gurney-nasa-doesnt-just-think-warp-drive-is-possible-theyre-working-on-it/\">this one</a> takes the cake:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Warp drive is possible. And NASA is on it&#8230;</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong><strong></strong>Alcubierre&#8217;s formula was reviewed and held to be&#8230; practically unusable. That may have changed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s Matt Gurney in this week&#8217;s National Post, sharing his justifiable excitement at the news that a NASA physicist who thinks he&#8217;s come up with a usable warp drive. On paper. According to mathematical formulae. Gurney is optimistic, although he admits that &#8220;it might take 100 years, or a thousand.&#8221; Contrast that with his fellow columnists, who think climate change was invented by a bunch of ignorant socialist lefties.</p>\n<p>The reference, incidentally, is to a concept known as an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive\">Alcubierre drive</a>. It&#8217;s one of several hypothetical methods of faster-than-light space travel. As a rule, nothing can travel through space faster than the speed of light. Miguel Alcubierre argued in the 1990s that you could essentially &#8220;cheat&#8221; by creating a special region of space around the ship, which he referred to as a bubble, which could flow through space-time like a wave. The ship would never travel at faster than the speed of light within the bubble, but the bubble <em>itself</em> would move at much higher speeds. The science Gurney is excited about is a new paper from a NASA scientist arguing that the energy requirements for the Alcubierre drive might be a fraction of what Alcubierre thought they would be. Hence, interstellar space travel is possible.</p>\n<p>Well, maybe. Alcubierre didn&#8217;t explain how to create a warp bubble, or how to get your spaceship out of one once you&#8217;re in it. The drive also needs about a tonne of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_matter\">exotic matter with negative mass</a> (which we don&#8217;t have any of, and can&#8217;t get any of, and which may not exist anyways). These are not small problems. So I&#8217;m truly befuddled at why the Post would be promoting warp drives but dismissing climate science.</p>\n<p>I should point out: I don&#8217;t think interstellar travel is actually a kooky idea. The first plans were drawn up by British and American researchers in the 1960s, with cool names like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Valkyrie\">Valkyrie</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Daedalus\">Daedalus</a>, and (hilariously) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Longshot\">Longshot</a>. Maybe if we&#8217;d put some serious thought into the subject, we&#8217;d be well on our way to experimenting with starship design by now.

You&#8217;re getting paid for this, aren&#8217;t you? You&#8217;ve got to do better than that.</p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t bother explaining to the national correspondent of a major newspaper why voting against an omnibus budget is a piss-poor way to judge whether you support any <strong>one</strong> of its many measures. I will, however, wonder precisely why said correspondent thinks it is his job to anticipate and even make some advance suggestions for the bullshit spin that some 30-year-old Conservative propagandist in the party campaign office might one day try to put on the budget.</p>\n<p>The only dilemma in all this is one faced by Conservative MPs: whether they will vote with their conscience, or with their wallets. Stephen Harper once declared that it was sacrilege for <strong>any</strong> MP to accept a public pension, let alone a watered-down one. He is a lying hypocrite on this subject, and so are many of his followers in Parliament. Watered-down doesn&#8217;t cut it.</p>\n<p>The weirdest part is, this is a gimme. Many of the people in Parliament don&#8217;t <em>really</em> need pensions, especially the Cabinet ministers who areÂ  ostensibly running the show. If they got rid of them altogether, then a long line of pundits, probably including the aforementioned Mr. High, will declare that this gives them the political capital to hack away at other public pensions at will. That will be a bullshit argument, too, by the way. But attacking the pensions of other Canadians while &#8220;gradually chipping away&#8221; at their own, to use another phrase being bandied about in the media, makes them extraordinary hypocrites.</p>\n<p>Speaking of Mr. Chase, I was a little alarmed to read this at the end of his article:</p>\n<blockquote><p>On paper it looks as if recently elected MPs supply <strong>$1 in annual pension-plan contributions for every $5 to $6</strong> anted up by the government&#8230; Sources say, in fact, MP contributions <strong>only amount to 14 per cent</strong> of the pension benefit that&apos;s accruing each year.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Oh, my.

The first stage was to check endorsements in recent elections. There was no left-wing bias there: virtually all major newspapers endorsed the Conservative Party. Then I checked guest op-ed contributions to 20 major papers. Again, there was no left-wing bias: conservative parties and business groups got vastly disproportionate access.</p>\n<p>The third stage is to look at the lists of regular columnists retained by newspapers, as opposed to guest writers. To avoid any debate about who&#8217;s &#8220;really right wing&#8221; or &#8220;really left wing,&#8221; generally speaking, unless they have previously worked with a political party or some other politically active organization with an ideological perspective, I count them as unaffiliated. I also define Liberal politicians as progressive, which is kind of stupid, I know.

This is the man responsible for overseeing the prosecution of white-collar crime in the most powerful country on Earth, stating in a public forum that what keeps him up at night is deciding whether that lawyer or CEO from the big corporation who popped by his office to defend a crime-committing corporation made a &#8220;compelling&#8221; case that they should just drop the whole matter. The general context is a speech extolling the virtues of &#8220;non-prosecution agreements,&#8221; which are the U.S. Department of Justice&#8217;s equivalent to a <a href=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=2753\">letter of warning from Elections Canada</a></p>\n<p><center><!--\ngoogle_ad_client = \"ca-pub-6874205322210204\";\n/* MajorBoard */\ngoogle_ad_slot = \"2063570446\";\ngoogle_ad_width = 468;\ngoogle_ad_height = 60;\n//-->\n<br />\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"\nsrc=\"http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js\">\n</center></p>\n<p>Even as right-wing governments prattle on about the virtues of minimum sentences, heavy jail terms, and various other tools of justice, they are increasingly reluctant even to impose the lightest of all possible sentences on corporate criminals and other white-collar ne&#8217;er-do-wells. Recently in Canada, for instance, the Competition Bureau <a href=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6164\">announced that a company</a> had been found guilty of rigging government bids. It paid a fine which looks to my uneducated eye to be equal to one-third of the value of the contracts it won through these means, and then was slapped with court order stating &#8212; hilariously &#8212; that the company was not allowed to break the law again.</p>\n<p>Apparently the good folks at the Competition Bureau, like their colleagues at the American DOJ, feel that corporations need not even be obliged to follow the law unless they are specifically orderd to do so.</p>\n<p>The politicians get their own kickbacks from this system, of course. Take the celebrated case of Toronto mayor Rob Ford. Charged with flagrantly ignoring the office-holder&#8217;s ethics code, Ford&#8217;s argument is that he need not be held guilty because he never bothered to read the code, and because his lawyer never brought it to his attention either.</p>\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6548\" data-text=\"Minimum Sentences for Us, Minimal Sentences for Them\" data-count=\"horizontal\">Tweet</a>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'Opinion','News',NULL),(295,0,0,'Religious Right Declares War on Condoms and Wizards in Ontario','text/html','http://sixthestate.net/?p=6533','Uncategorized;Canada',NULL,NULL,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,14,'If we&#8217;re going to have religious fundamentalists trying to rabble-rouse left, right, and centre, in this country, the conservative media is going to have to figure out how to cover them responsibly.

Say what you really think, and you are bound to alienate some of the votes that you need to win. But it&apos;s getting harder: even at private gatherings, today&apos;s politicians are likely to be secretly video-recorded, so they must NEVER reveal their true opinions.</p>\n<p>The latest victim of this rule is Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate for the US presidency. He needed to feed some red meat to the people who had paid $50,000 a head to attend a fund-raiser in May in Florida. Most of them doubtless believed that poor Americans are shiftless, Palestinians are evil, and Iranians are crazed fanatics, and they were not paying to have their views challenged. Still, he should have been more careful.</p>\n<p>Blaming the failure of 19 years of negotiation to bring a peace settlement in the Arab-Israeli dispute entirely on the Palestinians was not going to get him in trouble at home. \"The Palestinians have no interest whatsoever in establishing peace,&#8221; he said, which would be seen as a distortion of the truth in most parts of the world, but it does no harm to Romney domestically. Indeed, lots of Obama voters think that too.</p>\n<p>Same goes for the bizarre scenario he drew about the alleged threat from Iran. \"If I were Iran &#8211; a crazed fanatic, I&apos;d say let&apos;s get a little fissile material to Hezbollah, have them carry it to Chicago or some other place, and then if anything goes wrong, or America starts acting up, we&#8217;ll just say, &apos;Guess what? Unless you stand down, why, we&#8217;re going to let off a dirty bomb&apos;.\"</p>\n<p>This is only one or two steps short of expressing a fear of werewolves, but in the United States this sort of discourse is routine. The US Department of Defense regularly uses equally shoddy and cynical arguments to justify its huge budget. Romney will not get into any trouble with the electorate for this \"gaffe\".</p>\n<p>Where it all went wrong was when he said that \"There are 47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what,\" referring to the Americans who don&apos;t pay income tax. \"There are 47% who are with (Obama), who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it.\"</p>\n<p>The audience at the fund-raiser obviously believes that, and it&apos;s pretty likely that Romney believes it himself, but it is simply not true.</p>\n<p>If all of the 47 percent of Americans who do not pay income tax automatically vote for Barack Obama and the Democratic Party, then the Republicans can never win an election. At least not unless EVERYBODY who pays income tax votes Republican, which seems pretty unlikely.</p>\n<p>Surely some tax-payers must vote Democratic, even if they are only Latinos, African-Americans, gays, women, Asians, union members, and effete Eastern intellectuals. And some non-taxpayers certainly do vote Republican. In fact, the Republican Party&apos;s core strategy for decades has been to win white, working-class votes by stressing its conservative social values. Without their votes, the last Republican president would have been Dwight D. Eisenhower.</p>\n<p>But Romney actually dismissed the importance of those voters, although white, working-class voters who are unemployed or underemployed, and pay no taxes, could make the difference between victory and defeat for him. So could retired people too poor to pay taxes, who are often social conservatives.</p>\n<p>In Romney&apos;s view, his role \"is not to worry about those people (the 47 percent). I&#8217;ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\" If this is not outright contempt, it comes very close.</p>\n<p>It was especially reckless of Romney to couch the whole discourse in terms of who pay taxes or doesn&apos;t. This from a man who has refused to release more than the past two years of his own tax returns. Why endure all the criticism about not releasing the past five years, say, if there was nothing to hide in the returns for the preceding years? Like, maybe, the possibility that Romney paid no tax at all in those previous returns.</p>\n<p>The people who pay no taxes in the United States are the very poor and the very rich, and Romney certainly falls into the latter category. If he paid no tax at all in 2007, 2008 and 2009, say, he would have fallen into the 47 percent in those years.

So what happens when a clip from the film dubbed into Arabic goes up on the internet? Angry Muslims run through the streets smashing things and killing people.</p>\n<p>It&apos;s as simple as that: press the right button, and they&apos;ll do what you want. Some Christian extremists set out to provoke Muslim extremists into violence that would discredit Islam in the eyes of the West â€“ and it worked, of course. As the US consulate in Benghazi burned and the American dead were carried out, many people in the West thought to themselves: \"The Libyans are biting the hand that freed them.\"</p>\n<p>Wrong conclusion. It wasn&apos;t \"the Libyans\" who broke into the Benghazi consulate and murdered the US ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens; it was a heavily armed band of Islamic extremists. \"The Libyans\" recently voted in their first real election ever, and they elected a secular government. The film just gave the fanatics an opportunity to undermine that choice.</p>\n<p>Maybe the Christian extremists don&apos;t understand that their film serves the purposes of those who want to overthrow the moderate, democratically elected governments, both Islamic and secular, that have come to power in the \"Arab spring\". Or maybe they do realise that, and hope that the violence that they are stirring up will bring Muslim extremists to power in those countries. After all, it&apos;s easier to mobilise Western opinion against outright fanatics.</p>\n<p>The grown-ups try to keep the situation under control. Grand Mufti Sheik Abdel-Aziz al-Sheik, the highest religious authority in Saudi Arabia, said that Muslims should denounce the film, but without anger: \"Muslims should not be dragged by wrath and anger to shift from legitimate to forbidden action, (as) by this they will, unknowingly, fulfill some aims of the film.\"</p>\n<p>Exactly so, but the leaders of the Arab world&apos;s post-revolutionary governments have to walk a fine line, denouncing both the film and the violent protests against it. Moderate Islamic governments like that of Egypt&apos;s President Mohamed Morsi have a particularly tricky task, since they are competing with the Muslim extremists who are organising the protests for the support of the same pious and socially conservative bloc of voters.</p>\n<p>\"We Egyptians reject any kind of assault or insult against our prophet,\" Morsi said last Thursday, \"but at the same time we firmly say that this cannot be taken as a justification to assault consulates or embassies and cannot be taken also as a justification for killing innocent people.\"</p>\n<p>It was not a sufficiently robust condemnation of the violence for US President Barack Obama, who said on the same day: \"I don&apos;t think that we would consider (Egypt) an ally, but we don&apos;t consider them an enemy.\"</p>\n<p>Obama has his own right flank to protect, and cannot afford to acknowledge in public that elected Arab leaders are in competition with Islamic fanatics for popular support, and so must choose their words with care. Most American voters are not sophisticated enough to understand the intricacies of Arab politics, or patient enough to care.</p>\n<p>Similarly, most Arab voters do not want to hear about the American constitution, which guarantees free speech and means that the US government cannot just ban crude attacks on Islam by American citizens. The elected Arab leaders will certainly have had this fact explained to them in private by their political advisers, but in public they must demand that the US government suppress the film and punish its makers.</p>\n<p>It&apos;s not the United States that has attacked Islam, or even \"Hollywood\"; just a handful of Americans with a political and religious agenda. It&apos;s not \"Egypt\" or \"Libya\" that has attacked American and other Western diplomatic missions in the Arab world, but small groups of Islamic extremists with a political agenda of their own, supported by a larger number of pious dupes.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the film in question passed without notice when it had its single public screening in the Vine Theatre in Los Angeles in June; only a dozen or so people showed up, probably mostly friends of the producer. It attracted little more attention when a shortened version was posted on YouTube at the beginning of July.</p>\n<p>It only took off when the religious Egyptian television channel al-Nas broadcast scenes from it on September 8, and then posted a clip online with an Arabic translation. That got hundreds of thousands of views in a matter of days, and the violent protests began almost at once. The Christian fanatics and the Muslim extremists are, in the old Marxist phrase, \"objective allies.\"</p>\n<p>This is not a \"turning point\" in Western relations with the Arab countries or the broader Muslim world (as some excitable commentators have suggested). The whole thing will blow over after a little while, just like the violent protests against Danish newspaper cartoons about Muhammad did six years ago. It is a tempest in a teapot.</p>\n<p>_____________________________________</p>\n<p>To shorten to 725 words, omit paragraphs 3, 12, and 13.

Thinking is free, so let&apos;s think really big. Let&apos;s think about&#8230;building a starship in the year 2112.</p>\n<p>Well, I&apos;ve already been thinking about that for decades, actually, but that was just wishful thinking. Now there&apos;s a whole organisation for thinking about it, with a proper budget and government support and participation by private enterprise, and this week they&apos;re holding a public conference in Houston, Texas: the first annual symposium of the 100 Year Starship Initiative.</p>\n<p>The sessions have ambitious titles: \"Time and Distance Solutions\"; \"The Mission: Human, Robotic or Reconstituted?\"; \"Destinations and Habitats\"; \"Becoming an Interstellar Civilisation\". But the organisers also realise that this project will take as long as building a Gothic cathedral: one session is simply called \"Research Priorities for the First Ten of 100 Years\". Then they&apos;ll have to set priorities for the next ten years, and the next, and the next&#8230;.</p>\n<p>DARPA wanted to create an organization to foster \"persistent, long-term, private-sector investment into the myriad of disciplines needed to make long-distance space travel possible.\" The winning proposal, by the Dorothy Jemison Foundation for Excellence, declared that \"100 Year Starship will unreservedly dedicate itself to identifying and pushing the radical leaps in knowledge and technology needed to achieve interstellar flight.\"</p>\n<p>The 100YSS, as it&apos;s known, would probably not exist if the professionals interested in space flight had really challenging near-space projects to work on. They don&apos;t: one American space scientist described the current American space programme, and indeed those of its rivals elsewhere, as \"trying to finish what we started in the 1960s.\" Low-orbit operations are vital, but they are not inspiring.</p>\n<p>Some of these frustrated professionals work at NASA and the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), so there is official support for thinking big. There&apos;s not much money: DARPA gave the 100YSS only half a million dollars of seed money (out of its $3 billion budget), but then nobody is planning to build expensive hardware now. They just want to think about what kind of hardware (and software) would be needed to go to the stars.</p>\n<p>If they want to go on thinking big thoughts for very long, of course, they&apos;ll need more than half a million dollars, but the rest of the money will have to come from private enterprise. For the moment, that means mainly from the well-funded space companies founded by billionaire entrepreneurs who made their money in other new technologies, and now want to do something even more interesting.</p>\n<p>So appoint a charismatic former astronaut to lead the organisation â€“ Dr Mae Jemison, the first African-American woman in space â€“ and make sure that both private business and potential international partners feel comfortable with the approach. It&apos;s a natural area for international cooperation: there are probably never going to be rival national starship programmes. Add a truckload of ambition, a pinch of hard-nosed realism, and stir.</p>\n<p>The first public outing for this enterprise is the symposium in Houston, and its popular appeal is obvious. It&apos;s a heady thought that this may be where the future course of human history is set, and at this stage nobody has to deal with dreary things like budgets and project management. The most outrageous concepts can be welcomed, examined, and pursued or rejected. But is there any realistic prospect that human beings could ever build a starship?</p>\n<p>Nobody knows. As Douglas Adams&apos;s seminal work, \"The Hitch-Hiker&apos;s Guide to the Galaxy\", sagely observed: \"Space&#8230;is big. Really big. You just won&#8217;t believe how vastly, hugely, mindbogglingly big it is.\"</p>\n<p>Building a starship would therefore require not just four or five generations of technological revolutions. It would also require the overturning, or at least the wholesale reinterpretation, of the laws of physics as currently understood. Last time around, it took about five centuries, say from 1450 to 1950, to get through a comparable scale of change in technology and physics. But of course things move much faster now.</p>\n<p>At any rate, it&apos;s hard to see what harm the 100YSS could do, even if it never achieves its objective. If the history of space-flight up to now is any guide, at the very least it would produce radically new technologies that have major positive impacts on human welfare. And if it actually succeeded&#8230; That would be the biggest deal in human history.</p>\n<p>The most recent estimate is that there are about 30,000 planets suitable for our kind of life within a thousand light years of here. Most observers assume that if a planet can support life, then it will almost certainly have life. It would be a great pity to miss out on all that because of a mere lack of ambition.</p>\n<p>________________________________</p>\n<p>To shorten to 725 words, omit paragraphs 4 and 7.

This time was different.</p>\n<p>The victim this time was a 14-year-old Christian girl, Rimsa Masih, who is believed to suffer from Down&apos;s syndrome. She was stopped by a young Muslim man who found the half-burned remnants of a book that allegedly included verses from the Quran in her carrier bag. He told the local imam, who called the police, and she was arrested.</p>\n<p>This kind of story usually ends badly in Pakistan. Two years ago, for example, a Christian woman, Asia Bibi, was arrested for insulting the Prophet Mohammad while arguing with fellow farm-workers. She was sentenced to death by hanging, but it was such a manifest injustice that the governor of Punjab province, Salman Taseer, publicly called for the repeal of the blasphemy law. He was assassinated by his own bodyguard in January, 2011.</p>\n<p>The bodyguard was tried for murder and convicted, but he was treated as a hero by many Pakistanis, and the judge who sent him to prison had to flee the country. Two months later the only Christian member of Pakistan&apos;s cabinet, Shahbaz Bhatti, was also shot dead when he spoke out against the blasphemy laws. Since then, almost nobody has dared to criticise them.</p>\n<p>Asia Bibi remains in prison awaiting execution. Her entire family, including her five children, live in hiding and cannot work or go to school. And while the higher courts would once have thrown out her conviction â€“ they have overturned hundreds of sentences for blasphemy imposed by lower courts that were too vulnerable to local pressures â€“ she can no longer even be confident of that.</p>\n<p>So the outlook seemed grim for Rimsa Masih when she was arrested last month â€“ but then the imam who had called the police, Hafiz Mohammad Khalid Chisti, was arrested for doctoring the evidence. His own deputy had seen him adding pages from the Quran to the young Christian&apos;s bag.</p>\n<p>\"I asked him what he was doing,\" the deputy told a television station, \"and he said this is the evidence against them (the local Christians) and this is how we can get them out from this area.\" Two other witnesses came forward against Chisti, and Hafiz Mohammad Ashrafi, the chairman of the All Pakistan Ulema Council, a body of senior Muslim clerics, declared that \"Our heads are bowed with shame for what Chisti did.\"</p>\n<p>Ashrafi added that Chisti was acting on behalf of a group who wanted to drive out the Christian minority in the area: \"I have known for the last three months that some people in this area wanted the Christian community to leave so they could build a madrasa (on their land).\" They have already succeeded: some 300 Christian families have fled in fear for their lives, and they probably won&apos;t be back. But at least the state is starting to defy the fanatics.</p>\n<p>Bail is not normally granted in blasphemy cases, but on 8 September Rimsa Masih was freed on bail, and a military helicopter lifted her out of the prison yard and into hiding. And Paul Bhatti, the Minister for National Harmony, whose brother and predecessor Shahbaz was murdered last year, broke a political taboo by explaining why ordinary Pakistanis are more hostile to the religious minorities in their midst than most Muslims elsewhere.</p>\n<p>\"It is not just a religious problem,\" Bhatti said. \"It&apos;s a caste factor, because (the victims) belong to the poorest and most marginalised people. Unfortunately they are Christians, and this caste system creates lots of problems.\"</p>\n<p>Islam teaches the equality of all believers, but the caste system is alive and kicking in Pakistan. Go far enough back, and almost all Pakistani Muslims are descended from Hindus â€“ and when those Hindu communities converted to Islam, they retained their ideas and prejudices about caste.</p>\n<p>This was particularly disheartening for groups at the bottom of the caste pecking order who had hoped that Islam would free them. When the British empire arrived in the area, therefore, it was the poorest and most despised section of the population who converted to Christianity.</p>\n<p>So everybody knows that most Christians are really \"untouchables.\" The argument that got Asia Bibi in trouble, for example, broke out when some of her Muslim fellow workers refused to drink the water she had fetched because Christians were \"unclean\".</p>\n<p>The Hindu minority is mostly just as low-caste as the Christians, and equally vulnerable. Together they are only 6 million out of 187 million Pakistanis, but they account for the vast majority of blasphemy accusations. In many cases, these accusations are merely a convenient weapon for Muslims engaged in land disputes and other quarrels with members of the minority groups.</p>\n<p>Maybe the Pakistani government has finally found the nerve to deal with this corrupt law and to protect its victims. The Rimsa Masih case is a hopeful sign. But Pakistan still has a long way to go before all of its citizens are really equal under the law.</p>\n<p>___________________________________</p>\n<p>To shorten to 725 words, omit paragraphs 5 and 8.

It will be whatever Barack Obama say it should be, and besides, the delegates in Charlotte weren&apos;t interested.</p>\n<p>It&apos;s the economy, stupid, and two months before the election nobody wants to get sidetracked into discussing a peripheral issue like American foreign policy. The only people who really care about that at the moment are foreigners and the US military â€“ and even they are not following the election with bated breath, because few of them believe that a change of president could fundamentally change the way the US relates to the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>Although the Republicans do their best to paint Obama as a wild-eyed radical who is dismantling America&apos;s defences, he has actually been painfully orthodox in his foreign policy. He loves Israel to bits, he did not shut down the Afghan war (or Guantanamo), he uses drones to kill US enemies (and sometimes, anybody else who is nearby), and he tamely signs off on a $700 billion defence budget.</p>\n<p>How can Mitt Romney top that? He could say he loves Israel even more. In fact, he does say that, promising to recognise Jerusalem as Israel&apos;s capital. But that is purely gesture politics, since almost no other countries do, and in practice Obama gives Israel almost everything it wants already.</p>\n<p>He could pledge to spend even more on \"defence\" than Obama, but the United States is already pouring 4.7 percent of its Gross Domestic Product down that rathole. Obama has planned cuts over the next several years that would bring it down to about 4 percent â€“ and Romney has promised not to let it fall below 4 percent. Not a huge difference there.</p>\n<p>Romney does his best to disguise that fact by declaring that he would reverse certain of Obama&apos;s decisions. US ground forces, for example, would remain at their current level under a Romney administration, rather than being reduced by 100,000 people. But changing only that and nothing else would put $25 billion a year back onto the defence budget. How do you do that without raising taxes?</p>\n<p>The Republican candidate faces a constraint none of his recent predecessors had: a party that really cares about the deficit. In the past three decades, it has been Republican presidents who ran up the bills â€“ Ronald Reagan never balanced a budget, and the Bush-Cheney team declared that \"deficits don&apos;t matter\" â€“ while the subsequent Democratic administrations tried to curb out-of-control spending.</p>\n<p>Romney doesn&apos;t have that option: the Tea Party wing of his party actually means what it says about both taxes and deficits. So what&apos;s left for him? Well, he could promise to kill even more of America&apos;s enemies than Obama, but he can&apos;t get around the fact that it&apos;s Obama who nailed Osama bin Laden, and Obama who is playing fast and loose with international law by using drones to carry out remote-control assassinations of hostile foreigners.</p>\n<p>So Romney says very little about foreign policy because there is little he can say. The closest he has come to specific policy changes was an \"action plan\" he laid out during the Republican primaries last year, to be accomplished within a hundred days of taking office. It was an entirely credible promise, because none of it really involves a policy change at all.</p>\n<p>He promised to \"re-assure traditional allies that America will fulfill its global commitments.\" A couple of phone calls, and that&apos;s done.</p>\n<p>He declared that he would move more military forces to the Gulf \"to send a message to Iran,\" but he didn&apos;t threaten to attack Iran, or endorse an Israeli attack on Iran.  And he can always move them back again if he gets bored.</p>\n<p>He said he would appoint a Middle East czar to oversee US support for the evolving Arab transitions. That&apos;s one more government job, but Romney has even less idea than Obama about where he wants those transitions to end up. Besides, the United States has almost no leverage on this issue.</p>\n<p>He will review the Obama administration&#8217;s planned withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not necessarily change it; just review it.</p>\n<p>He will also review Obama&apos;s global missile defence strategy. He might like to change that â€“ Republicans have loved the concept ever since Ronald Reagan&apos;s \"Star Wars\" dreams â€“ but he hasn&apos;t got the kind of money he would need for a more ambitious policy.</p>\n<p>He will increase the government&#8217;s focus on cybersecurity. Ho-hum.</p>\n<p>He will raise the rate of US Navy shipbuilding. So far as budget constraints permit, which is not very far at all.</p>\n<p>And he will launch an economic opportunity initiative in Latin America. As long as it doesn&apos;t cost much money.</p>\n<p>It&apos;s not surprising that the rest of the world doesn&apos;t care much about the US election. Most foreigners, on both the right and the left, are more comfortable with Obama than Romney, but US foreign policy will stay the same whoever wins. They might not like all of it, but they&apos;re used to it.</p>\n<p>______________________________</p>\n<p>To shorten to 725 words, omit paragraphs 6, 15, 16 and 17.

It&apos;s already down to around 4 million square kilometres, with a least another week of melting to go, but this is what you might call a \"known unknown.\" Scientists knew we were losing the ice-cover fast; they just didn&apos;t know how fast.</p>\n<p>I&apos;m no fan of Don Rumsfeld, who helped to lead the United States into the disastrous invasion of Iraq when he was George W. Bush&apos;s defence secretary, but I never had a problem with the distinction he made between \"known unknowns\" and \"unknown unknowns\" when discussing the intelligence data. He was brutally mocked in the media for using such jargon, but there really is a difference.</p>\n<p>A \"known unknown,\" in the case of the Arctic Ocean, is how long it will be before the entire sea is ice-free at the end of each summer. The last report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), published in 2007, talked about that happening some time in the second half of this century, but it couldn&apos;t be more specific.</p>\n<p>The IPCC usually underestimates the rate of climatic change, but even the pessimists didn&apos;t think we&apos;d get there before the 2030s. I did encounter one maverick at the National Ice and Snow Data Centre who thought it might happen in this decade, but nobody actually knew. A \"known unknown,\" in other words.</p>\n<p>There were also some assumptions about what would happen next in the Arctic. At first the ice would return each winter, although it would be thinner and less extensive than before, but as time passed the ice-free period would get longer.</p>\n<p>A frozen ocean reflects sunlight back into space, but open water absorbs it and turns it into heat, so the ocean itself would now be getting warmer. The warmer water would inhibit the growth of ice even in winter, and eventually the Arctic Ocean would be ice-free all year round â€“ but nobody knew when this would happen.</p>\n<p>As for the impact that an ice-free Arctic Ocean might have on climates elsewhere, it would obviously accelerate the global warming trend, but beyond that there wasn&apos;t much to go on. This was the territory of the \"unknown unknowns\": big things might happen to the complex atmospheric system of the planet when a major chunk of it suddenly changes, but nobody knew what.</p>\n<p>Now we begin to see the consequences. The polar jet stream, an air current that circles the globe in the higher northern latitudes and separates cold, wet weather to the north from warmer, drier weather to the south, is changing its behaviour.</p>\n<p>In a paper in Geophysical Letters last March entitled \"Evidence linking Arctic amplification to extreme weather in mid-latitudes,\" Jennifer Francis of Rutgers University and Stephen Vavrus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison offered a hypothesis that may explain why world grain prices have risen 30 percent in the past four months (and are still going up).</p>\n<p>First, a warmer Arctic reduces the temperature gradient between the temperate and polar zones. That, in turn, slows the wind speeds in the zone between the two and increases the \"wave amplitude\" of the jet stream. The jet stream flows around the planet in great swooping curves, like a river crossing a flat plain, and those curves â€“ Rossby waves, in scientific language â€“ are getting bigger and slower.</p>\n<p>The bigger amplitude means the Rossby waves reach farther down into the temperate zone than they used to, and the slower winds means that the waves take more time to track across any given territory. The weather north of the jet stream is wet and cold (even warmer Arctic air is still pretty cold), and to the south it is dry and warm â€“ and now many temperate regions of the planet are stuck in one kind of weather or the other for much longer periods.</p>\n<p>This is a recipe for extreme weather. In the old days the Rossby waves went past fast, bringing the alternation of rainy and sunny weather that characterised the mid-latitude climate. Now they hang around much longer and generate more extreme weather events: droughts and heat-waves, or prolonged rain and flooding, or blizzards and long, hard freezes.</p>\n<p>The temperate zone has been seeing a lot of that sort of thing in the past couple of years â€“ much more than usual. It&apos;s cutting deeply into food production in the major breadbaskets of the planet, like the US Midwest and southern Russia, which is why food prices are going up so fast. And this was an \"unknown unknown\": nobody saw it coming.</p>\n<p>All the scenarios that the military of various countries were working with assumed that climate change would hit food production very hard in the tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world, and that is still true.

We cannot leave in our underpants&#8230;or without any.\" That was Mikhail Gorbachev addressing senior Soviet officers in 1987, two years before the Soviets pulled out. Two years before NATO pulls out, the same frantic search is underway for something that could be called a victory, or at least \"peace with honour\". Meanwhile, NATO soldiers die, together with many more Afghans.</p>\n<p>The French are smart: all their troops will be gone from Afghanistan by the end of this year. The Canadians were even smarter: almost all their troops left last year. But the rest of the NATO countries dumbly soldier on towards the scheduled departure date of 2014, even though the situation is clearly spinning out of control: one-quarter of the 48 Western troops killed in Afghanistan this August were murdered by Afghan government soldiers.</p>\n<p>The most striking thing about these so-called \"green-on-blue\" killings, according to a 2011 Pentagon analysis reported by Bloomberg, is that only 11 percent of them are the result of infiltration by the Taleban. Most of them are due to grudges or disputes between coalition and Afghan army troops, which suggests that NATO&apos;s current focus on training Afghan forces to \"stand up\" on their own is just as futile as all its previous strategies.</p>\n<p>Last year a team of US Army psychologists investigated the nature of these grudges and quarrels, conducting interviews with dozens of American and Afghan focus groups. Their report, \"A Crisis of Trust and Cultural Incompatibility\", concluded that the Afghan troops see the American soldiers as \"a bunch of violent, reckless, intrusive, arrogant, self-serving, profane infidel bullies hiding behind high technology.\"</p>\n<p>The US troops, in return, generally view their Afghan allies as \"a bunch of cowardly, incompetent, obtuse, thieving, complacent, lazy, pot-smoking, treacherous and murderous radicals.\" This does not constitute the foundation for a successful collaboration.</p>\n<p>The view of the Afghan soldiers is more positive, despite all that, than the civilian population&apos;s attitude towards the foreign forces. A poll conducted in late 2010 by the Afghan Centre for Socio-Economic Research reported that nearly sixty percent of civilians wanted all the foreign soldiers gone within a year. Forty percent would still want the foreigners out even if their departure meant that the violence got worse.</p>\n<p>In the main conflict areas, forty percent of the population believed that roadside bombings and other attacks aimed at killing US and other foreign forces were justified. And almost everybody hates and despises the gang of warlords and racketeers who make up the US-backed government of Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Yet less than ten percent of Afghans, according to the same poll, actually want to see the Taleban back in power. They are not being inconsistent. They just don&apos;t buy the standard Western line that only the foreign occupation has kept the Taleban and their alleged al-Qaeda allies from returning to power.</p>\n<p>There is some evidence that the Taleban themselves don&apos;t really believe that either. They remember that even when a Taleban government ruled in Kabul in 1996-2001, they never succeeded in extending their authority to the northern parts of the country where the non-Pashtun minorities live â€“ and taken together, those minorities account for sixty percent of the population.</p>\n<p>In an interview published in the \"New Statesman\" last month, a senior Taleban commander known as \"Mawlvi\" told Michael Semple, a former United Nations envoy to Kabul during the period of Taleban rule, that \"the balance of power in the Afghan conflict is obvious. It would take some kind of divine intervention for the Taleban to win this war.\"</p>\n<p>The foreigners have lost their war, but the Taleban, still overwhelmingly Pashtun, will not be able to defeat all the other ethnic groups in the civil war that follows NATO&apos;s departure. In fact, they won&apos;t even do as well as they did in the similar civil war after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989: \"The Taleban capturing Kabul is a very distant prospect,\" Mawlvi said.</p>\n<p>He may be wrong about that. His assumption is that after the foreigners leave the Afghan army, which is overwhelmingly recruited from the non-Pashtun groups, will break apart into the same Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara militias that thwarted the Taleban&apos;s drive to control all of Afghanistan after the Soviets left.</p>\n<p>But those ethnic militias no longer exist, and their former commanders have grown fat and corrupt in the service of the foreigners. It might prove impossible to rebuild them fast enough to thwart a post-occupation drive by the Taleban to seize the whole country â€“ although they would probably be unable to hold the non-Pashtun areas in the long run.</p>\n<p>The Taleban have won their war against the foreign occupiers, but they probably won&apos;t win a decisive victory in the civil war that follows. And the only remaining way that the foreigners could still influence the outcome would be to dump their puppet president, Hamid Karzai, and start rebuilding the ethnic militias now.</p>\n<p>They won&apos;t do that, so their continued military presence over the next two years is irrelevant to the ultimate outcome. And public opinion in Afghanistan is turning against them so fast that they might still end up leaving without their underpants.</p>\n<p>___________________________</p>\n<p>To shorten to 725 words, omit paragraphs 7, 10 and 11.

It took something as hugely short-sighted as Obama&apos;s cancellation of the Constellation programme in 2010 to make him speak out in public. But when he did, he certainly did not mince his words.</p>\n<p>\"We will have wasted our current $10-billion-plus investment in Constellation,\" he said, \"and equally importantly, we will have lost the many years required to recreate the equivalent of what we will have discarded. For the United States&#8230;to be without carriage to low Earth orbit and with no human exploration capability to go beyond Earth orbit&#8230;destines our nation to become one of second or even third rate stature.\"</p>\n<p>Barack Obama was never a politician with a big international vision. He has experts to do that stuff for him, and of course they are all part of the \"Washington consensus,\" which is just as parochial as he is. So he cancelled the big Ares rockets that would have taken American astronauts back to the Moon and onwards to Mars and the asteroids. Some other spending programme just yelled louder. Maybe the Navy wanted another aircraft carrier.</p>\n<p>If NASA (the National Aviation and Space Administration) wants to put an American into space now, it has to buy passage on a Russian rocket, which is currently over $50 million per seat. By 2015 the Chinese will probably be offering an alternative service (which may bring the price down), and before long India may be in the business as well. But the United States won&apos;t.</p>\n<p>There is likely to be a gap of between five and ten years between the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet last year and the first new American vehicles capable of putting a human being into space. Even then it will only be into low Earth orbit: none of the commercial vehicles now being developed will be able to do what the Saturn rockets did 41 years ago when they sent Neil Armstrong and his colleagues to the Moon.</p>\n<p>Armstrong was a former military officer who would never directly call the President of the United States a liar or a fool, but his words left little doubt of what he really thought: \"The availability of a commercial transport to orbit as envisioned in the president&#8217;s proposal cannot be predicted with any certainty, but is likely to take substantially longer and be more expensive than we would hope.\" In other words, don&apos;t hold your breath.</p>\n<p>He was equally blunt about Obama&apos;s assurances that the United States was not really giving up on deep space: \"While the president&#8217;s plan envisages humans travelling away from Earth and perhaps toward Mars at some time in the future, the lack of developed rockets and spacecraft will assure that ability will not be available for many years.\" Not the return to the Moon by 2020 planned by the Constellation programme, but pie in the sky when you die.</p>\n<p>This is not a global defeat for manned exploration of the solar system. The Russians are talking seriously about building a permanent base on the Moon, and all the major Asian contenders are working on heavy-lift rockets that would enable them to go beyond Earth orbit. It&apos;s just an American loss of will, shared equally by Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.</p>\n<p>\"I know China is headed to the Moon,\" Romney told a town hall audience in Michigan in February. \"They&apos;re planning on going to the Moon, and some people say, oh, we&apos;ve got to get to the Moon, we&apos;ve got to get there in a hurry to prove we can get there before China. It&apos;s like, guys, we were there a long time ago, all right? And when you get there would you bring back some of the stuff we left?\" Arrogant, complacent, and wrong.</p>\n<p>Americans went to the Moon a long time ago, but the point is that they can&apos;t get there now, and won&apos;t be able to for a long time to come. Which is why, in an interview fifteen years ago, Neil Armstrong told BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh: \"The dream remains. The reality has faded a bit, but it will come back, in time.\" It will, but probably not in the United States.</p>\n<p>_____________________________</p>\n<p>To shorten to 725 words, omit paragraphs 5 and 9.

When he appeared on the balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he has been holed up for the past two months to avoid extradition to Sweden for questioning about allegations of sexual assault, he wisely said nothing about those claims â€“ but some of his friends did.</p>\n<p>George Galloway, the British member of parliament who founded the Respect Party, shares Assange&apos;s suspicion that the whole affair was a \"set-up\" to get him to Sweden, from which he would be extradited to the United States to face trial for \"espionage\" for placing a quarter-million US diplomatic cables on the internet. That was what Assange talked about on the balcony last Sunday â€“ but Galloway could not resist the opportunity to talk about sex.</p>\n<p>Galloway never misses a chance to put himself in the public eye, so he released a podcast on Monday saying that Assange was only guilty of \"bad sexual etiquette.\" Thanks, George. The last thing Assange needed was for public attention to be distracted from his claim that the US was plotting to seize and jail him and diverted instead to the details of the alleged sexual assaults.</p>\n<p>Some of those details are indeed peculiar. The two Swedish women each said that she had consensual sex with Assange, but was asleep or \"half-asleep\" when he initiated sex again. The real issue in both cases was apparently his failure to use a condom on the second occasion, but neither woman claimed rape. Indeed, one of them threw a party in Assange&apos;s honour the following evening, and asked him to stay in her room again afterwards.</p>\n<p>Worried about the condom issue, they subsequently asked him to take an STD test, and went to the police when he refused. The Swedish police issued an arrest warrant for him on 20 August, 2010, but one of Stockholm&apos;s Chief Prosecutors, Eva Finne, cancelled it the following day, telling the press: \"I don&apos;t think there is reason to suspect that he has committed rape.\"</p>\n<p>Ten days passed before her decision was overturned by another Chief Prosecutor, who issued a European Arrest Warrant for Assange (who was in London by then) demanding that he be sent to Sweden for questioning. The British police arrested him in February, 2011, and he spent the next sixteen months on bail, fighting extradition. When his last appeal was denied in June, he jumped bail and took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy.</p>\n<p>But why doesn&apos;t he just answer the Swedish police&apos;s questions? They haven&apos;t even charged him with anything at this point. His answer is that he&apos;d be happy to talk to them in London, but that if he goes to Sweden the United States will lay charges against him (it hasn&apos;t done so yet) and demand his extradition. Even if he is never charged with rape or some lesser offence by Sweden, he would then face decades in an American prison.</p>\n<p>Again, there is something peculiar about how the British and Swedish governments are playing this. Sweden has sent prosecutors abroad to interview people suspected of serious crimes before, precisely to determine whether it should lay official charges against them. This time, it won&apos;t do that. And neither government will state that it will not let Assange be passed on to the Americans, although he says he would go to Stockholm if they did.</p>\n<p>So is there really an American plot to whisk Assange away and lock him up for good?</p>\n<p>There&apos;s no question that many senior American officials would like to do exactly that. Vice-President Joe Biden called him a \"high-tech terrorist,\" and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described his action as \"an attack on the international community.\" Great powers are always vindictive towards those who reveal their dirty secrets.</p>\n<p>However, the official American outrage that prompted those comments was triggered by Assange&apos;s big document dump in November, 2010. The incidents in Stockholm and the Swedish request for his extradition happened before that.</p>\n<p>There is also the question of why it would be easier for the US government to extradite Assange from Sweden than from the United Kingdom, assuming that it eventually does indict him? There is a serious question as to whether US laws on treason, espionage, etc. can be applied to a foreign citizen who has never lived there.</p>\n<p>More importantly, London and Stockholm would both be deeply reluctant to hand Assange over to the tender mercies of the American justice system. They would face a huge outcry from their own citizens, most of whom think that WikiLeaks is a useful check on the untrammelled exercise of American power in the world: the domestic political price would be too great.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the remarkable absence of a US indictment and a subsequent demand for extradition after all this time suggests that Washington knows there would be no point. So there probably isn&apos;t a US plot to grab Assange.</p>\n<p>There probably wasn&apos;t a rape either, but that&apos;s for the Swedish courts to decide. Assange should allow them to get on with it.</p>\n<p>___________________________</p>\n<p>To shorten to 725 words, omit paragraphs 8 and 12.

But professional demagogues don&apos;t have to worry about the details, and Malema was fundamentally right in what he said next.</p>\n<p>\"Zuma doesn&apos;t care about the mineworkers, he came here last night and met with whites,\" Malema said. \"It&apos;s not the white British (mine-owners) who were killed. It was you.\" And in a final slap at the governing African National Congress (from which he was recently expelled): \"They only come to you when it&apos;s time for elections. Once you put that cross, they disappear.\"</p>\n<p>Julius Malema fills the same role in today&apos;s South Africa that Winnie Mandela did in the dying days of apartheid in the early 1990s: the radical demagogue who uses violent, often anti-white invective to articulate the rage of the impoverished black majority. This terrifies South Africans who have something to lose, black and white alike.</p>\n<p>Malema preaches hatred of the rich and hints at social revolution. The fact that he has become mysteriously rich himself at the age of 31, although his only jobs were as an official of the ANC Youth League, doesn&apos;t bother his millions of admirers at all. They just want to see a real redistribution of the country&apos;s wealth in their favour, and they think Malema is their best bet.</p>\n<p>They are probably wrong. Malema is ruthless and cunning enough to have a chance at winning power some time towards the end of this decade, when the ANC&apos;s political near-monopoly finally collapses. But he is not skilled enough, and perhaps not even clever enough, to push through that sort of redistribution without destroying South Africa&apos;s industrial economy in the process. Nevertheless, many of the poor feel they have nowhere else to turn.</p>\n<p>It is now 18 years since the fall of apartheid, and a substantial class of prosperous middle-class blacks has emerged (together with a small group of very rich people with close links to the ANC). However, the poor majority remain desperately poor, and they no longer trust the ANC to bring positive change in their lives. They are starting to defect politically, and the main battle is being fought on the territory of the trade unions.</p>\n<p>Mining is South Africa&apos;s biggest industry, and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) is the country&apos;s biggest union. It is closely tied to the ANC, but many believe that it is also in bed with the bosses. Cyril Ramaphosa (who chaired the ANC&apos;s disciplinary appeals committee that expelled Malema from the ANC early this year) was the founder of the NUM 30 years ago, but now he is on Lonmin&apos;s board.</p>\n<p>The Lonmin strike is actually a turf war. The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (ACMU), a new, radical union, has been stealing the members of the National Union of Mineworkers, including three or four thousand of the 26,000 men working in Lonmin&apos;s platinum mine. ACMU promised to triple the workers&apos; wages, and the violence began when it tried to stop NUM members from going to work.</p>\n<p>Ten people were killed in clashes between the two unions in mid-August, including two police who were hacked to death with pangas (machetes). So the police were understandably nervous last week when they faced an angry mob of about 3,000 workers armed with pangas, spears and clubs.</p>\n<p>Unleashing a torrent of automatic fire that killed 34 strikers and wounded 78 was an act of gross indiscipline, but frightened men, even if they have far better weapons, will not always respond in a measured and disciplined way when they are under attack. The reflex, unfortunately, is to hold the trigger down and spray the threat with bullets.</p>\n<p>Nobody wanted this tragedy to occur, and it is unlikely to happen again in the same way. Jacob Zuma will still probably be re-elected as the leader of the ANC in December and go on to a second term as president. There will be a commission of inquiry, and judges will reach conclusions and make recommendations.</p>\n<p>But the main political beneficiaries of the incident are the forces that are trying to loosen the grip of the ANC&apos;s old guard on the unions and the country. It has been a very auspicious occasion for Julius Malema, who is trying to position himself as the only real alternative to Zuma and the gang. Some time later in the decade, the Lonmin massacre may come to be seen as a turning point in South Africa&apos;s history. Or not, because history does not run on rails.</p>\n<p>____________________________________</p>\n<p>To shorten to 725 words, omit paragraphs 5 and .

Today&apos;s Moncton Times and Transcript offers us several examples, right up there on the front page. We&apos;ll start at the bottom with the most glaring one, \"Moncton tops in tax competitiveness\".<br />Sounds good - so long as you don&apos;t think about it. What does &apos;tops&apos; in tax competitive mean? Well, it means you can do business in Moncton without paying much (or sometimes any) tax at all. To be tops in tax competitiveness is something like being tops in the food chain for crows. Similarly, Moncton is now tops in Canada for secretiveness in reasons for deciding where to locate schools.<br /><br />Being tops is something that gives the impression of being good even when it&apos;s very very bad.<br /><br />One thing that makes us tops is low worker compensation costs. Isn&apos;t that nice? That means people who are already rich find it easier to get even richer in Moncton. So, any time you feel you&apos;re getting ripped off, don&apos;t complain.March proudly downtown with your sign \"We&apos;re no. 1\".<br /><br />Oh, yes - the company that produced with good news for us - it&apos;s called KPMG. It&apos;s a big, big company. And what does it do? Well, the report doesn&apos;t tell us much about that. But if you check Wikkipedia, you&apos;ll find it there. It&apos;s a sort of good samaritan company that helps rich people avoid taxes. And, sometimes, its lust to do good gets out of control. There&apos;s been a good deal of talk about fraudulence, and even some pleading of guilty to criminal charges for fraud.<br /><br />The TandT doesn&apos;t mention that - and that&apos;s understandable. Why drag up the past? What we have here is not a news story at all. What we have here is propaganda which, now I think of it, fits in with most of the \"news\" in The Moncton Times and Transcript.<br /><br />At the top of the page is a similar report, this one a poll by another company known only by initials, MQO. What are its connections? What is its record? Who knows? And who, at the TandT cares? Hey, it&apos;s a polling company. (I guess they&apos;ve never heard of polling companies that make their money out of producing studies with results that the people who pay for the poll want to see.)<br /><br />The headline emphasizes that this is good news. We, it says, are \"shoptimists\". The good news is that people surveyed planned to spend less money in the coming year. Okay. But why is that good news? After all, the poll results given show that people intend to cut their spending.<br /><br />Oh. But they explain that, sort of. The numbers have been going down now for several years. So it&apos;s good news its not worse news. And, in the end, what does this all mean?<br /><br />Nothing whatever. The reality is that the whole world is shaky on many counts. In any case, what we plan to do while talking on the phone to a pollster can be pretty seriously affected by things we didn&apos;t plan on. Possibly, quite probably, this isn&apos;t a news story at all. &amp;nbsp;Quite probably, it&apos;s a loaded poll concocted to keep up consumer confidence - or, least, to slow down the drop in consumer confidence.<br /><br />A good newspaper would take the trouble to check its sources. Who pays the bill for these sources? What sort of record to they have? Who is their ownership? Initials like MQO and KPMG tell the reader nothing. What is the company referred to as Atlantic Matters? What sort of clientele does it serve?<br /><br />Frankly, one of these sources is obviously a propaganda outfit for big business. The other looks suspiciously like a propaganda outfit for smaller business. And the reporters, typically for the TandT, wrote what they were told to write, and asked no questions.<br /><br />There&apos;s a different kind of non story on the same page \"Future of Via Rail discussed\". This concerns a \"public meeting\" held at city hall. Wow! \"Public meeting\" That rouses images of mass rallies, even of the French revolution with ringing speeches and heads falling. Actually, though, it was fifty people - a number you could find in any good bar.<br /><br />What could the point of the open meeting possibly be? What was council going to learn about rail service &amp;nbsp;from a very random sample of fifty people of no particular expertise? Why not get some expert advice?<br /><br />Actually, it did. Maybe. The feature of the \"public meeting&apos; was a Richard Gormick, leader of a project to save rail service across Canada. He passed through Moncton on a tour of the Maritimes. What makes him an expert? &amp;nbsp;He has written on transport. (Hey, I&apos;m an expert. I&apos;m writing on transport right now.) And he&apos;s also an advisor on transport.<br /><br />What has he written? Who has he advised? Who knows? The reporter didn&apos;t think it important to ask him.<br /><br />None of this is to question the value of Mr. Gormick&apos;s credentials or advice. He may very well be worth listening to. But why couldn&apos;t the newspaper tell us that and tell us why? And, since Mr. Gormick seems to have been the only person to say anything of importance at this \"public\" meeting of council, why make it public in the first place?

Today&apos;s Moncton Times and Transcript offers us several examples, right up there on the front page. We&apos;ll start at the bottom with the most glaring one, \"Moncton tops in tax competitiveness\".<br />Sounds good - so long as you don&apos;t think about it. What does &apos;tops&apos; in tax competitive mean? Well, it means you can do business in Moncton without paying much (or sometimes any) tax at all. To be tops in tax competitiveness is something like being tops in the food chain for crows. Similarly, Moncton is now tops in Canada for secretiveness in reasons for deciding where to locate schools.<br /><br />Being tops is something that gives the impression of being good even when it&apos;s very very bad.<br /><br />One thing that makes us tops is low worker compensation costs. Isn&apos;t that nice? That means people who are already rich find it easier to get even richer in Moncton. So, any time you feel you&apos;re getting ripped off, don&apos;t complain.March proudly downtown with your sign \"We&apos;re no. 1\".<br /><br />Oh, yes - the company that produced with good news for us - it&apos;s called KPMG. It&apos;s a big, big company. And what does it do? Well, the report doesn&apos;t tell us much about that. But if you check Wikkipedia, you&apos;ll find it there. It&apos;s a sort of good samaritan company that helps rich people avoid taxes. And, sometimes, its lust to do good gets out of control. There&apos;s been a good deal of talk about fraudulence, and even some pleading of guilty to criminal charges for fraud.<br /><br />The TandT doesn&apos;t mention that - and that&apos;s understandable. Why drag up the past? What we have here is not a news story at all. What we have here is propaganda which, now I think of it, fits in with most of the \"news\" in The Moncton Times and Transcript.<br /><br />At the top of the page is a similar report, this one a poll by another company known only by initials, MQO. What are its connections? What is its record? Who knows? And who, at the TandT cares? Hey, it&apos;s a polling company. (I guess they&apos;ve never heard of polling companies that make their money out of producing studies with results that the people who pay for the poll want to see.)<br /><br />The headline emphasizes that this is good news. We, it says, are \"shoptimists\". The good news is that people surveyed planned to spend less money in the coming year. Okay. But why is that good news? After all, the poll results given show that people intend to cut their spending.<br /><br />Oh. But they explain that, sort of. The numbers have been going down now for several years. So it&apos;s good news its not worse news. And, in the end, what does this all mean?<br /><br />Nothing whatever. The reality is that the whole world is shaky on many counts. In any case, what we plan to do while talking on the phone to a pollster can be pretty seriously affected by things we didn&apos;t plan on. Possibly, quite probably, this isn&apos;t a news story at all. &amp;nbsp;Quite probably, it&apos;s a loaded poll concocted to keep up consumer confidence - or, least, to slow down the drop in consumer confidence.<br /><br />A good newspaper would take the trouble to check its sources. Who pays the bill for these sources? What sort of record to they have? Who is their ownership? Initials like MQO and KPMG tell the reader nothing. What is the company referred to as Atlantic Matters? What sort of clientele does it serve?<br /><br />Frankly, one of these sources is obviously a propaganda outfit for big business. The other looks suspiciously like a propaganda outfit for smaller business. And the reporters, typically for the TandT, wrote what they were told to write, and asked no questions.<br /><br />There&apos;s a different kind of non story on the same page \"Future of Via Rail discussed\". This concerns a \"public meeting\" held at city hall. Wow! \"Public meeting\" That rouses images of mass rallies, even of the French revolution with ringing speeches and heads falling. Actually, though, it was fifty people - a number you could find in any good bar.<br /><br />What could the point of the open meeting possibly be? What was council going to learn about rail service &amp;nbsp;from a very random sample of fifty people of no particular expertise? Why not get some expert advice?<br /><br />Actually, it did. Maybe. The feature of the \"public meeting&apos; was a Richard Gormick, leader of a project to save rail service across Canada. He passed through Moncton on a tour of the Maritimes. What makes him an expert? &amp;nbsp;He has written on transport. (Hey, I&apos;m an expert. I&apos;m writing on transport right now.) And he&apos;s also an advisor on transport.<br /><br />What has he written? Who has he advised? Who knows? The reporter didn&apos;t think it important to ask him.<br /><br />None of this is to question the value of Mr. Gormick&apos;s credentials or advice. He may very well be worth listening to. But why couldn&apos;t the newspaper tell us that and tell us why? And, since Mr. Gormick seems to have been the only person to say anything of importance at this \"public\" meeting of council, why make it public in the first place? Why rob the councillors of a chance for a more intense meeting with Mr. Gormick?<br /><br />Let&apos;s try a guess at what happened.<br /><br />Mr. Gormick is touring the region. He understands this region. He knows that a public meeting on a serious issue wouldn&apos;t draw flies. New Brunswickers just aren&apos;t built that way.

But let&apos;s go back to the closing of diplomatic relations with Iran. Why did Harper do it? He gave two reasons.<br />1.He was refusing to have relations with a country with a terrible record for abuse of human rights.<br />&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;That&apos;s absurd.<br />&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;We maintain the closest relations with a country which is the world&apos;s leading torturer. We have even allowed them to practice torture on Canadians, without protest. We took part in a war on Libya in cooperation with the US; and it was a war that was illegal under international law. The US has killed civilians by the million just in Harper&apos;s lifetime. We heap praise on China which, I am reliably informed, has been known to abuse human rights quite severely.<br />&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Harper is clearly lying. He doesn&apos;t give a damn about human rights.<br /><br />2. He said the failure of the Iranian governments to protect embassies makes it too dangerous for Canadian diplomats to be stationed there. Okay - so how come everybody else isn&apos;t packing up? In fact, Harper has now endangered Canadian diplomats in Moslem countries all over the world by his move.<br /><br />&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Now, Harper&apos;s not dumb. He may be \"Liar, liar, pants on fire\". But he&apos;s not dumb. So what&apos;s going on?<br /><br />&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; This week, (and barely hinted at in the TandT), he&apos;s in New York where he&apos;s going to meet with Netanyahu. Obama is in New York, too. But he won&apos;t meet with Obama (and Obama won&apos;t meet with Netanyhu.) None of this makes any sense. Netanyahu&apos;s only concern is bombing Iran. It is scarcely likely that Canada can play a significant role in that. Right now, only Obama can.<br /><br />&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Oh, and Harper won&apos;t, while in New York, be speaking to the general assembly of the UN, even though some organization has named him \"World Statesman of the Year\". (God help us.)<br /><br />&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; What&apos;s going on here? Whose game is Harper playing? Who are we going to play flunkys for? - and let&apos;s not kid ourselves we can be anything but a flunky where the stakes are this high. Nor is Harper a world statesman of any sort. The last person we had who came close to that was Lester Pearson.<br /><br />&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Then there&apos;s the curiosity of Harper deciding to bunk in with the Brits on embassy space. It&apos;s worth reading Alec Bruce on this. Really, if it&apos;s money he wants to save, he should have kept a closer eye on the purchase of fighter planes.<br /><br />&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;But don&apos;t expect to get any news on this in the TandT. It&apos;s source for Harper news is PostMedia - and PostMedia is National Post - and National Post in The Moncton Times and Transcript with more expensive pimps. You can count on it always to kiss up to Harper.<br /><br />&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On the use of words, take note of Norbert&apos;s column. He says the U.S. ambassador to Libya was killed by Islamist \"extremists\". Now, Norbert is a man who takes words seriously. And I have no doubt that people who kill are doing something extreme, and can reasonably be called extremists.<br /><br />&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;But extremist isn&apos;t just a descriptive word. It packs a meaning that is emotionally loaded - and usually ugly. It also implies that in being extreme, the person described is wrong. So, let&apos;s see. George Washington led a revolution. That&apos;s pretty extreme. American presidents ordered the bombings of Cambodia and Vietnam that killed millions of innocent people. George Bush Sr. was head of the CIA when it slaughtered a quarter million people in Guatemala. About 1920, Winston Churchill ordered the bombing of undefended, civilian villages in the Kurds in Iran. Ever see the word extremist attached any of those people in your newspaper?<br /><br />&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Of course not. That sort of language becomes an unconscious form of propaganda. We kill innocent people by the million. We aren&apos;t extremists. We&apos;re defending democracy. They shoot back. They&apos;re extremists and terrorists.<br /><br />&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Of course, in the end extremists and terrorists lose. Look what happened to General Custer. And not a minute too soon.<br /><br />Norbert adds a very sad note about the Roman Catholic church. Agree or disagree, it&apos;s worth thinking about - and not only in respect to the Roman Catholic church. We, perhaps particularly in the western world, have lost any sense of right or wrong, of good or evil. As Norbert says, the decline of the churches is continuing- to which we might add that, either because of that or as a result of the decline - right and wrong have ceased to exist.<br /><br />We have governments so corrupted by power and money that how power and money are gained, and how they are used, is irrelevant. Anything which creates more power and money is acceptable. If it means creating mass poverty around the world, that&apos;s okay. If it means murdering innocent people - not to worry. &amp;nbsp;If it means lowering standards of living in Moncton, destroying the environment and the future for New Brunswick, that&apos;s fine.<br /><br />Do what you like. The churches won&apos;t criticize you. Hell, for a big enough donation, some of them will name a church after you.The message of Christianity, in particular, is reduced to sermons that are careful not to mention anything that is really happening (as an abstract thought, it&apos;s wrong to be greedy. But that&apos;s never mentioned n regard to our economic system which is based on greed.)<br /><br />In the place of right and wrong, we get abstractions. We get emphasis on some point of bigotry and discrimination that is based on a very naive reading of The Bible. You can, for example, discriminate against gays. If such discrimination were against Jews or native peoples or Africans, it would be unacceptable. But pointing a finger at gays will make any drunken lout into a man of God. (Interestingly, Hitler, in Mein Kampf, based his condemnation of Jews on Catholic teaching. The British Empire justified its killing and exploitation on the word of God. So did our ancestors who either killed or displaced the native peoples.)<br /><br />We have, long ago, lost any sense of right and wrong. That may explain a lot about the serious decline we are facing in the world.<br /><br />de Adder&apos;s cartoon makes good deal of sense. Be very cautious in the language debate (as Dr. Parrott was not.) There are bigots on both sides. There are fools on both sides. And they are the ones who grab the headlines in these debates.<br /><br />I watched, up close, as such a debate destroyed Quebec both socially and economically. And it was all tarted up on both sides with words that had emotional punch but that nobody understood. Culture is the one that always sticks in my mind. And both sides are guilty of that one.<br /><br />If only for very practical reasons, New Brunswick must accept language duality. Luckily, the words practical and right (in the moral sense) are almost interchangeable. New Brunswick has to concentrate on doing the right thing. It&apos;s done a pretty good job so far. There needs to me more -but fighting between English and French isn&apos;t going to help. Indeed, it could destroys things for everybody.<br /><br />The French language, for reasons that we have no control over, will always be under pressure in New Brunswick. And that would be true if the whole province were unilingual French. Movies, TV, radio, and popular music would guarantee that. Both francophones and anglophones need to understand that and accept the reality. It&apos;s the not the fault of anybody on either side. It&apos;s just a reality.<br /><br />Nor can dualism be simply a law. It has to be an attitude, a spirit, willingness on the part of all of us. Laws create two sides. We can&apos;t afford that. And we shouldn&apos;t even want to afford it. If any issue cries for an understanding of right and wrong, this one does.<br /><br />I see I&apos;ve rambled a bit in the last couple of blogs. Sorry. There&apos;s just so little in the TandT worth talking about.<br /><br />I have submitted my \"right to information\" request concerning Highfield Square. Still no response. So today, I shall drop a note to my two council members and to the mayor. I&apos;m sure they will be eager to ensure that the system works smoothly.

For venom, rant and ignorance, I had never &amp;nbsp;see its equal. And it was frequently made worse by op ed pieces from Atlantic Institute of Market Studies, a propaganda house for big business.<br /><br />It wasn&apos;t hard to figure out why it started. Big business wanted the public schools. It wanted them for the only reason it could want them - personal profit. That&apos;s why business \"think tanks\" gave prominence to \"scientific\" studies which showed the schools were producing poor results.

Therefore, I would not run for office for either of them. Nor would I vote for either. But &amp;nbsp;Dr. Parrot joined the Conservative club and sat, not only in the legislature as a Conservative, but as a member of the caucus in which the party carries on its confidential discussions.<br /><br />Dr. Parrott expresses quite different views from the party, and expresses them publicly. So Mr. Alward says he can&apos;t come to the clubhouse any more. Fair enough. Nobody is saying he can&apos;t say whatever he wants to say - any time, any place. He still has a seat in the legislature. He still has full access to the public and to the news media. He can still criticize the government.<br /><br />Indeed, I cannot understand why he ran as a Conservative in the first place. He seems to have nothing in common with that party. Or with the Liberals. &amp;nbsp;(and, in my book, that&apos;s good.) So he should check out the other parties. If he doesn&apos;t like them, he should start his own or run as an independent. (Indeed, his popularity might make him a quite challenging independent.)<br /><br />But, in expelling him from caucus, Premier Alward did what any party leader has every right to do. (In fact, I would at least have called him on the carpet for the way he expressed himself on language duality.)<br /><br />There&apos;s a story on p. A7 that reminds me of a time I asked a man who he hired to plough his driveway. What I got was a long answer, delivered in something between a whine and a teary plea for justice. What I got was a lecture, a cry of despair that there aren&apos;t enough enterpreneurs in this world. We live, apparently, in world of people with no drive, no hustle, no ambition, no spirit of enterprise. It wasn&apos;t an answer so much as it was an appeal to justice and to the deepest values.<br /><br />At the end, he said, yes, he knew a man who would do it for $20. This information was followed by another whine, \"He&apos;s an entrepreneur\", and the whine really meant, \"Why aren&apos;t there more people like that?\"<br /><br />Well, the man I was questioning was a quite successful businessman. He lived in the propaganda world of big business, a propaganda I had seen often enough spread in commerce courses as well as in The Moncton Times and Transcript. Entrepreneurs are good. Entrepreneurs build societies and prosperity. We should encourage everybody to be an entrepreneur, and then get out of the way. Get rid of government regulations and taxation that only crush the souls of these saints.<br /><br />Now to p.

Never mind that it has created the economic disaster we living through, that it lives off brutal exploitation and poverty in countries like Haiti and Congo (and, often enough, Canada.) We&apos;ll forget, for the moment, it makes money out of an infrastructure it refuses to pay taxes for. We&apos;ll even forget that pay raises seldom come from \"entrepreneurs\". They more often come from the workers themselves when they join unions.<br /><br />And entrepreneurs, the very big ones, have created the growing wage gap that is destroying western society. They are,as well, hypocrites. For all their preaching about government being bad and inefficient, They need big government. They live off it. They need big government to fight their wars, to supply them with roads and bridges and trained workers, to give them resources like timber and oil, to quash any civil unrest they cause. They need big government to buy their produce. If the US, for example, didn&apos;t have a government big enough to buy more weapons than any country in the world, it would have almost no industry at all.<br /><br />Yes, this is a role for the entrepreneur. But it would be nice to have a newspaper to give us balanced information rather than just publicity blurbs for \"think\" tanks.<br /><br />By the way, if the panel were one on how young people should get active in unions, &amp;nbsp;would the TandT have made such a big story - or any story - out of it?<br /><br />In NewsToday (which, like all newspapers, is really NewsYesterday), there is one story worth a read. \"Minister vows to end prison pizza parties\". The minister is Vic Toews, Canada&apos;s minister of public safety - which includes prisons ,who is very worried that eating pizzas and having chocolate bunnies (which do not raise prison costs), will spoil prisoners, That going for a walk with their families will turn them into raging beasts. Lots of people, who know nothing about prisons or the people in the them, think he&apos;s right. That&apos;s why he and Harper are busy returning our prison system to medieval times - to create even more and worse criminals.<br /><br />That appeals to the people who vote for the Harpers and Toews of this world.<br /><br />Norbert&apos;s column looks nice; but it&apos;s so vague (and sometimes so plain wrong) that it&apos;s just meaningless. He uses the word ideology, for example, without seeming to know what it means. Or he makes ideology acceptable for one party &amp;nbsp;(the Conservatives) while unacceptable for another party (the NDP) - even though the Ottawa Conservatives are far the most ideological of the two.<br /><br />As well, he refers to news media as &apos;biased&apos; media - the implication being that they aren&apos;t biased at all. Come off it, Norm. &amp;nbsp;Look in a mirror.<br /><br />In an intriguing column, Alec Bruce talks of the rise of unmarried couples, of single parents as shown in the census. Without taking any side as right, doesn&apos;t this suggest a more general breakdown of social customs? We have a rise of consumerism, a rise is self-centredness, a decline of community volunteerism (most notable in the near collapse of youth groups which were so prominent from about 1900 into the 1970s. A large part of this collapse due to the lack of adult volunteers.) Then there is the decline of religious institutions, not only in numbers but in activities.<br /><br />In parallel, we have developed a business ethic that says self-interest is good. Greed is good. That concern only for oneself is good. There is surely a good deal more to this census that shows in the figures.<br /><br />A final thought, I came across information that Crandall University, which discriminates against gays, has received, on average, some two million dollars a year from us tax payers. I had known about the $150,000 from the city. But two million a year from public funds?<br /><br />I cannot recall ever reading a report on this in the TandT. &amp;nbsp;Has any read ever seen one?<br /><br />I have read all the Baptist defences of this. It is certainly true that they have a right to exercise their religious beliefs. But there are at least two exceptions to this. They don&apos;t have a right to inflict their beliefs on others. And they don&apos;t have a right to expect taxpayers to pay for the cost of their religious beliefs.<br /><br />Consider this. Moslems set up a university in Moncton. They refuse to permit either Christians or Jews any access to employment in it or use of it. They also demand 200 million a year in taxpayers&apos; money.<br /><br />Do you see Moncton&apos;s Baptists out there demonstrating in the streets in favour of Moslem U and its government handouts?<br /><br />And let&apos;s not even guess how they would react to a gay university.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/373697047018228084-1948033781582564320?l=themonctongrimes-dripdrain.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',1348834734,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fri, 21 Sep 2012 14:59:00 +0000',NULL,'The Moncton Times@Transcript - Good and Bad',NULL,'....and, oh, it hurts.<br /><br />I don&apos;t agree with the values (if they have any) of the New Brunswick Conservatives or the Liberals. Therefore, I would not run for office for either of them. Nor would I vote for either. But &amp;nbsp;Dr. Parrot joined the Conservative club and sat, not only in the legislature as a Conservative, but as a member of the caucus in which the party carries on its confidential discussions.<br /><br />Dr. Parrott expresses quite different views from the party, and expresses them publicly. So Mr. Alward says he can&apos;t come to the clubhouse any more. Fair enough. Nobody is saying he can&apos;t say whatever he wants to say - any time, any place. He still has a seat in the legislature. He still has full access to the public and to the news media. He can still criticize the government.<br /><br />Indeed, I cannot understand why he ran as a Conservative in the first place. He seems to have nothing in common with that party. Or with the Liberals. &amp;nbsp;(and, in my book, that&apos;s good.) So he should check out the other parties. If he doesn&apos;t like them, he should start his own or run as an independent. (Indeed, his popularity might make him a quite challenging independent.)<br /><br />But, in expelling him from caucus, Premier Alward did what any party leader has every right to do.

It was given in a quite exclusive club; and only the wealthy were &amp;nbsp;invited to attend. The message was simple.<br /><br />The middle class and the poor in the US were lazy, spoiled, and had a sense of entitlement to that which &amp;nbsp;they had not earned. It&apos;s not a surprise he made such a speech. It&apos;s not a surprise that his wealthy audience applauded.<br /><br />I&apos;ve known many people who sit in boardrooms, who are rich and have been rich from birth, and who routinely pour contempt on everybody who isn&apos;t rich. (That&apos;s even true for those who were born into money like George Bush in the US and __fill in the blank_____________ in New Brunswick.) In those circles, they hire entertainers who sing songs that ridicule the poor, and employees in general.<br /><br />These are the people that Alward and Harper answer to. That&apos;s why, in a time of recession,, they take the axe to services for people who need services but can&apos;t afford them. That&apos;s why they investigate unions, but not corporations. That&apos;s why Americans have such poor health care. That&apos;s why the US cuts spending on school meals for hungry children while it cuts taxes for the very rich. That&apos;s why they don&apos;t give a damn what drilling for shale gas might do to you. It&apos;s a perfectly normal and human reaction.<br /><br />Even the very rich, though, &amp;nbsp;have consciences that need to be kept quiet. They make their money out of exploiting other people with the lowest possible wages and the cheapest possible services. If there&apos;s a recession caused by their own greed and illegal behaviour, then they rationalize it as the fault of the poor. I&apos;ve read many of their statements that do exactly that. They hire columnists for their newspapers who make a point of saying that sort of thing. Guess who the TandT routinely blames for a strike, any strike. Bus drivers, they say, aren&apos;t worth it. Ever see the TandT say that a billionaire wasn&apos;t worth it?<br /><br />Their banks go broke? Not their fault. They get a enormous bailouts all over the US and Europe. And the poor will pay through cut social programmes. And the bankers will get bonuses and tax cuts. Greece&apos;s billionaires go broke - and the middle class and the poor get condemned to generations of hardship for it.<br /><br />Until you have met the rich, you can have no idea what contempt they hold you in, and how highly they think of themselves. How else could they rationalize their thievery?<br /><br />Romney took that contempt of the poor to make a point that the poor were the lazy, useless, \"entitled\" people who supported Obama. He said that they were also the 47% to 48% who supported Obama.<br />In fact, the ones who pay little or no taxes are the ones who support Romney, just as they are the ones who support Alward and Harper. I haven&apos;t seen a figure for Canada, but in the US, 25 of the largest corporations paid no income taxes whatever. (The poor who don&apos;t pay taxes are people who have no money. The rich who don&apos;t pay taxes are those who get sweetheart deals from politicians, or who have bogus head offices on remote island states.) The rich who skip taxes are a small percentage of the total population - but they are one hell of a proportion of what doesn&apos;t get paid.<br /><br />Will this have much effect on the election? I doubt it. Most American news media are owned by the very rich. They&apos;ll either ignore the story, or explain it away - or attack Mother Jones for revealing it. Will the middle class be affected by the story? Some will. Some not. Many middle class like to kid themselves in the same way the rich do. They&apos;ll say the rich help us all by their generosity in giving. Sure. Steal a billion. Give a few hundred thousand back. And the TandT will write you up as philanthropist.<br /><br />It should be possible to see the video on Google, Mother Jones, or Youtube.<br /><br />That&apos;s why P. A4 has a story on fees for government services going up. That&apos;s why children going to public schools have to pay fees and buy school supplies. That&apos;s why drinking and gambling, long recognized in most societies as creators of addictions and social problems, are encouraged for everybody by government. The keep taxes for the rich down. (You pay them in lottery tickets.) The level of gambling and its problems were much lower when it was all controlled by the mob.<br /><br />The lead story in NewsToday is a good example of how The TandT is still stuck in the 1890s. It&apos;s headed \"Census data to provide family snapshot\". So what? We know what a census is. What&apos;s important is what&apos;s in it. But the newspaper went to bed shortly before the census was released so it didn&apos;t know what&apos;s in it.<br /><br />That&apos;s why the story is useless information. And by the time you read the paper today, you could have had the story of what&apos;s in it on Google news. All the story in the paper does is to confirm that newspapers are useless for this sort of story. Now - a detailed analysis of what it tells us about Moncton and New Brunswick could be useful for tomorrow - something to give the census meaning to us.<br /><br />C12 has an example of a very bad story, \"Dozens of charities lose their tax-exempt status\". (This is in relation to federal taxes.) What&apos;s wrong with is that Postmedia simply took a government statement. and used that as a story. - Really, a reporter is supposed to ask questions.<br /><br />The headline spoke of dozens of charities. But it gave reasons for only two. So what&apos;s the scoop on all the others? After all, Harper has been known to cut off charitable groups that he just doesn&apos;t like. We need to know that. But any Postmedia reporter who asks the wrong kind of questions can expect to end up counting &amp;nbsp;snowflakes at the North Pole..<br /><br />The editorial, as expected, is pretty silly. Again it says bus drivers are overpaid. (Has it ever carried an analysis of whether the TandT&apos;s owner is overpaid? or the TandT&apos;s editor?) As well, it&apos;s suggestions of how to redesign the transit system are childish and even ignorant. What he would do is to create a system just dandy for 1945. That way we could have an antique transit system so we could read our antique newspaper on the way to work.<br /><br />And, Wow! Norbert likes Bob Dylan, and knows something about him. I wonder if Norbert still has his flared jeans. It&apos;s a side of &amp;nbsp;him I never guessed.<br /><br />The op ed page is,well, it is. What can y&apos; do, eh?<br /><br />Where is the story, now over a week old, of the Moncton physicians and other medical workers who demanded a moratorium on shale gas?<br /><br />Where is the story on the American woman who is being deported - almost certainly to an American prison - because she was disgusted by what she saw as a soldier in Iraq? She was in Canada as a refugee from the treatment she expected in the US for becoming anti-war. (The US is, after all, the country that uses torture, solitary confinement, and in which one can be imprisoned indefinitely without trial simply on the word of the president or the army.) Her children, born in Canada, will also be deported - but separated from their mother.<br /><br />She went to war. She saw the killing of civilians, many of them children. It turned her against war.<br />George Bush dodged war service. He killed over a million people. We are sending a women of conscience to prison because she has a conscience. We honour Bush because he doesn&apos;t have a conscience.<br /><br />There are warrant out for Bush in several countries, countries on our side with whom we have agreements to deport people to be tried for their crimes. Bush is charged with war crimes, among them torture. Would Harper depart Bush? No. But he will deport a woman with two children because she opposes war.<br /><br />Our hero.<br /><br />I have written to city council about the pollutants under Highfield Square.

That&apos;s why I chose the wrong solution. I was damned lucky there was time to make up for my mistake. Israel may not be so lucky. Nor we. Consider these points....<br /><br />1. Israel depends absolutely and entirely on US support for &amp;nbsp;its economy and its security. This tiny country with a population not much larger than metro Toronto gets more US foreign aid than any other country in the world. Virtually all of is powerful military is US equipped. This is a very, very dependent country.<br /><br />(Just to put that in context, every year some 15 million children, twice the Jewish population of Israel, die of starvation.)<br /><br />The US is very much larger, and with a far greater range of concerns. But Israel, heavily dependent Israel, insists that the US MUST automatically support Israeli policy no matter what its own interest might be. This has become an open fight, with Netanyahu publicly insulting the US president over it.<br /><br />Do you see something out of balance in that? Canada is much bigger than Israel. It doesn&apos;t need foreign aid. It&apos;s a major market for the US, a far bigger one than Israel, and a far more important one for resources. And it&apos;s far more important for the future of the US economy and its defence than Israel is.<br /><br />Can you imagine a Canadian prime minister publicly demanding that the US shape it entire foreign policy to put Canadian wishes in top priority? (Well, maybe. We have a Canadian prime minister stupid enough to be playing Netanyahu&apos;s game.)<br /><br />2. No countries are friends. Toasts to eternal friendship sound nice at banquets. The reality is that all countries have interests that would lead them to slit anybody&apos;s throat.<br />The US was a great pal of the UK, Canada, France. But it didn&apos;t stir a finger when the UK was in danger of invasion and Canada was up to its neck in war. Nor did it help France. In fact, during the war, it bled as much money out of the UK as it could - and it tried very hard to take over the old, British and French empires. What do you think Vietnam was all about? As for being buddies with South Vietnam, it cooperated in the assassination of its president. <br />Canada and the US will brag about their \"tolerance\" of Jews. In fact, neither did a damn thing to help Jews in the 1930s, though we all knew what was going on. We wouldn&apos;t even accept them as refugees during the war. Both Canada and the US were thoroughly anti-semitic.<br />Just wait till the day coming soon when the US runs low on fresh water. See how nice it is to us when that happens. And it&apos;s not just the US. Canada would be just as bad if it were bigger.<br />The US does not help Israel because it is friends. It helps Israel because that gives the US a useful ally in the region. But that could change at any time.<br /><br />3. But Nethanyahu has placed all his bets on a \"friendship\" with the US. It may not work much longer. The US, along with much of Europe, is an empire in collapse. It has not been impressive militarily for 70 years. It&apos;s hopelessly in debt. There is every chance it is facing internal disorder, every chance it will then have to drop Israel.<br /><br />As it is, Israeli has spies in the U.S. Some have been caught, and deported or jailed. And there is no reason to doubt there are American spies in Israel. So much for friendship.<br /><br />That means that anybody who encourages Israel into a war with a Moslem country may be cutting Israel&apos;s throat. Israel desperately needs to come to terms with its neighbours. Otherwise, the only edge it will have over them is its nuclear arsenal -and firing even one bomb could lead to consequences none &amp;nbsp;of us can imagine.<br /><br />4. The US would love to invade Iran. It already has, at least once; and it has also supported and supplied an Iraqi war with Saddam Hussein against Iran. But the dangers now are pretty high. The US has very foolishly interfered and warred with many Moslem countries in the last 70 years. It has created one hell of a reaction in the form of terrorism. It now has to contain that terrorism, reverse the slippage of its empire in Africa, the middle east and Latin America and, at the same time, face a rising China. Meanwhile, the US is steeply in decline, and may well have to make nice with Moslems.<br /><br />In consequence, those many yahoos who think they are helping Israel with its demand for war against Iran are more likely to be helping it to destruction. Certainly, that is what is going through the minds of the Israeli Defence Force staff chiefs and Israeli intelligence. That&apos;s why they think - and have said publicly, that a war on Iran is sheer stupidity. More wars will be suicide for Israel. It needs peace.<br /><br />Anyone who has a slick and easy solution for this problem, please write to us, and let the world in on your wisdom,<br /><br />In return, I&apos;ll send that person an anti-gas pill to take next time he gets a sharp pain in the stomach.<br /><br /><img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/373697047018228084-1276947470780986894?l=themonctongrimes-dripdrain.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',1348834735,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Sun, 16 Sep 2012 14:31:00 +0000',NULL,'The Moncton Times@Transcript - Good and Bad',NULL,'Inevitably, if you argue current events, somebody is bound to say \"All you do is talk about problems.

They&apos;re now lying by omission. Their position is by now quite clear.<br /><br />They will support fracking for shale gas at whatever the risk to the people and the lands and waters of this province. The government doesn&apos;t listen to us or to doctors who know something about medical risks.

And the reason they offer is that this will provide jobs - until, of course, they have destroyed the earth as effectively as they have destroyed capitalism and democracy.<br /><br />In the past year, while the poor have been getting poorer, the very rich have actually been getting richer. Latest studies around the world show the wage gap continues to grow, even as tens of millions more fall into poverty.<br /><br />Common sense would tell a child the outcome of this. As the poor get poorer and the rich richer, fewer have money to buy goods. That means even more poverty as businesses cut back on staff. The remedy proposed by the rich? Cut the taxes of the rich. Right. Make the wage gap even bigger. Impoverish even more. Ultimately, set off severe violence all over the world (which, now I come to think of it, is happening.)<br /><br />Common sense would tell a child this.

There, she was horrified by the slaughter of civilians. This was not at all what what she had been raised to believe America was about.<br /><br />On her return, her conscience would not allow her to stay in the army; so she sought refuge in Canada. Big mistake. Harper is deporting her within days. She will almost certainly be separated from her two, young chldren, and imprisoned.<br /><br />Harper, you could have protected her. It&apos;s not as if she did damage to anyone or betrayed a trust or killed anybody. &amp;nbsp;Harper, can you spell bastard?<br /><br />On the editorial page, the editorial is the usual bombast, Norbert is harmless; I profoundly disagree with Alec Bruce (first time, I think.)

Alec - think of priorities.<br />Think of consequences.<br /><br />There are two, absorbing columns by Lynda MacGibbon and David Suzuki. I agree with both, but think ms. MacGibbon has to look at the church, itself, as part of the problem. One part of the problem is, of course, the highly commercialized and consumerist world that the business world (which has taken over the task of parenting) has created.<br /><br />But then there&apos;s the problem that the churches have largely failed to get past ritual (and some mythology) to deal with the issues Jesus talked about. Jesus did not come to say, \"Nyah, Nyah. My mother&apos;s a virgin and yours isn&apos;t.\" He dealt with rather more important problems. But you&apos;d never know it from listening to most sermons.<br /><br />As for the rioting in the Moslem world, why the surprise? And, no, the anti-Mohammed movie is not the cause of it. It&apos;s the trigger. It&apos;s not the gunpowder.<br /><br />There is a reality, several realities, ignored by almost all of the western press. For over a century, western powers have been invading Moslem countries (among others). They have killed by the millions. The have killed or impoverished mothers, fathers children.

(This did not escape the notice of Moslems.) They created a paranoia which made it seem justifiable to invade Iraq, which had nothing to do with 9/11. Hatred of Moslems was easily extended to a trillion dollar assault on Afghanistan which, almost certainly, had nothing to do with 9/11. It is now used to justify attacks on Pakistan, Libya, Syria, and sundry African countries.<br /><br />Let&apos;s get real.

This is a time for church-goers to think over what their faith is all about -and to do something.<img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/373697047018228084-6083846760141564365?l=themonctongrimes-dripdrain.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'Opinion','Opinion',NULL),(323,0,0,'Sept. 13: Maybe I&apos;m too hard on the TandT....','text/html','http://themonctongrimes-dripdrain.blogspot.com/2012/09/sept-13-maybe-im-too-hard-on-tandt.html','City',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-13 08:31:18',17,'...maybe they aren&apos;t lying.

It has cut its presence in Dieppe. That impression is reinforced on p. A 15. \"Billboard company reduces Dieppe presence\". &amp;nbsp;Again, it is the company that has taken action. And it is a company that has just been fined for infractions of the Dieppe signs bylaw which requires bilingual signs.<br /><br />So, the invisible sub headline is \"Pattison Outdoor Advertising tells French where to get off.\"<br /><br />Now, I am no admirer of any law that tells private companies what language their signs should be in. I&apos;ve seen it in Quebec. I&apos;ve seen the idiocy and trouble it can lead to. I also think that city councils which operate on the principle that you can make people respect the language of others by forcing them to put up signs in your language - especially with the added idiocy that the language they have to respect must go on top - are being pretty stupid.<br /><br />I grew up in a Montreal district in which most people were French - and so were most signs. And some French who lived in majority English districts saw more English signs. Big deal. I thought nothing of it. Then, a law that required ALL signs to be in French only or to have French in letters twice as big as English did not make me respect my French neighbours more. Quite the contrary.<br /><br />I think advertisers in a francophone district should have advertising that is at least bilingual - or even unilingual French. But it&apos;s up to them. They&apos;re the ones with something to sell. Passing a law in such a case is simply going to encourage resentment and even bigotry on both sides. But back to Pattison Outdoor Advertising...<br /><br />What Pattison did was to say his business in Dieppe is slowing because advertisers don&apos;t like the extra expense. In that respect, Pattison was not cutting or reducing or doing anything. &amp;nbsp; And the one thing he did do was to take down one (count them, one) billboard.<br /><br />In other worse, that only thing Pattison did in any sense of the word &apos;cut&apos; was to take down one billboard. That means the story has one hell of a misleading headline. And why does taking down one billboard justify a &amp;nbsp;front page story that, in its continuation, goes on for almost a full page?<br /><br />It this a deliberate attempt to stir up anglo bigotry? Or is the Moncton Times and Transcript simply incompetent? Bookies are offering 50/50.<br /><br />A4 has a gush-gush, kiss-kiss story about Frank McKenna.<br /><br />There&apos;s an important story in Newstoday, page 1. \"Pakistan factory fires kill 314 workers\". It&apos;s important because someday soon, it could be about you.<br /><br />The workers, in two factories, died because conditions in the factories were unsafe. Of course. Pakistan has virtually no safety regulations or enforcement for private business, and only weak unions to put pressure on factory owners. Why should the owners care about safety? They&apos;re in business to make profits. Safety cuts into profits. So they hire workers cheap, demand long hours, and don&apos;t give a damn about safety.<br /><br />We&apos;re part of that. It&apos;s part of what&apos;s called globalization. It&apos;s what gives us low prices on clothes and electronics. And who are the owners who care so little about human life? Well, a good many of them are members of some of Canada&apos;s \"better\" families. And they care as much (or as little) for people &amp;nbsp;in Canada as they do for those in Pakistan.<br /><br />Think of that. Think shale gas. Think oilsands. Think Arctic oil drilling. Think breaking up unions. After all, ordinary people have very little \"worth\". Remember that term when it has been used in the TandT in connection with our bus strike?<br /><br />Factories in Canada used to be like the ones in Pakistan. And it wasn&apos;t the owners who cleaned things up. It took voters and unions almost a century to do that. Now, we&apos;re heading back to the bad, old days. Get used to it. Investors don&apos;t give a damn about you or &amp;nbsp;your family or your health. They even lack the wit to understand that all this greed and damage is eventually going to hurt them.<br /><br />Read the whole story. It&apos;s also about you.<br /><br />C16 has another important story - that because of the murder of the US ambassador to Libya, Canada is worried about the safety of its diplomats over much of the world. I have a special concern, here. One of my early students is now Canada&apos;s ambassador to a Moslem country. When I last saw him, a half-dozen years ago, he was already living in danger. An armed guard was constantly with him, and &amp;nbsp;his car had light armour. It&apos;s needed because in much of the world Canada is perceived (rightly) as being a puppet for American big business. My former student, much as I like him, is quite clearly such a puppet.<br /><br />Harper broke diplomatic relations with Iran. It was to make attacks on Iran that have no practical effect on anything. He withdrew the diplomatic staff from Iran because, &amp;nbsp;he said, he did not want to leave them in danger of attack from an Iranian mob. There are two problems with that.<br />1. He made his attack on Iran while the staff was still there - and needed a week to get out. Great way to protect them.<br />2. That act, as we now see, has put our diplomats around the world in danger. Great thinking, Steve.Are you going to withdraw them all?<br /><br />Oh - a cute note. Read the last sentence of the story. It&apos;s about how terrorism became a major concern after 9/11. That&apos;s the day 2,700 Americans died in New York.<br /><br />Actually, there were acts of terrorism long before that.<br /><br />From 1965 to 1973, the US airforce dropped on Cambodia far more tonnage of bombs than had been dropped by all the allied forces all over the world during World War Two, making Cambodia, a country the US wasn&apos;t even at war with, the most heavily bombed country in history. Estimates of the dead range to 600,000 and more. It was done -and this was openly admitted - to cause terror. I think that&apos;s what&apos;s called terrorism.<br /><br />Before and into the administration of George Bush sr., the CIA directed a genocide of Maya civilians in Guatemala. The dead included men, women, children, babies. Whole villages were wiped out. I think that&apos;s called terrorism.<br /><br />But it&apos;s not the same is it? We grieve with New York. But we never even think of those civilians our side has murdered and still murders. I mean, they&apos;re not people like us. Not really. So we mourn for the victims in New York. But any Canadian who suggested we should mourn for the Cambodians or the Maya would be regarded as a crackpot. It can be terrible to kill in order to terrorize. But it depends on who is the killer, and who is the victim.<br /><br />So terrorism didn&apos;t become a concern until 9/11.<br /><br />The editorial is a kiss-up to some rich people. It uses big words to make itself sound important.<br /><br />Norbert&apos;s column is trivial - but interesting. However, it should not be on an editorial page. That page - and op ed - is for serious comment. I have seen nothing to suggest that Norbert is capable of serious and informed comment. I would cettainly encourage him write the sort of catchily interesting stuff he can do: but put it a few pages earlier in the Life and Times section.<br /><br />Alec Bruce&apos;s column can seldom be long enough to say all that I&apos;m sure he could say. Today&apos;s is a good one. But I&apos;ll just add a blunt bit.<br /><br />The defence industries in Canada and the US are as corrupt as they come. The reason Canada cancelled the Arrow is quite possibly because the US defence industry wanted a monopoly on aircraft production. The reason we&apos;re getting stuck with an American fighter plane with a price tag that can climb faster than any jet can is because the major purpose of the defence industry is to rip off tax-payers. Harper will stick with an American plane that doesn&apos;t work because those are the rules of the US-Canada relationship.<br /><br />The defence industry has always been like that. If you know an old hunter, ask him about the Ross rifle.<br /><br />Rod Allen&apos;s op ed column begins with a photo of him showing a straight face. That&apos;s the only part of the column worth looking at.The rest of the column is about an idea for students that will be appealing for old grouches of low intelligence, but raise raise enormous educational and social problems.<br /><br />Jody Allaire is, as always, intelligent and well-informed. It&apos;s also a reminder that the world can march backwards as well as forwards - and commonly goes backward more quickly than forward.<br /><br />There&apos;s an interesting Letter to the Editor about nurses. I was appalled to read about the salaries and working conditions of nurses. However, I think she makes a big mistake in attacking the bus drivers as if they were the cause of her problems. That&apos;s playing an old game. I&apos;m our sure our bosses love the underpaid to fight the underpaid. But the reality is that it is not the bus drivers who are to blame for conditions in nursing. Nor will them getting less pay mean the nurses will get more. On contrary, if the bosses can get away with paying the drivers less, then they&apos;ll also try to pay the nurses less.<br /><br />Fight &amp;nbsp;your enemy. Don&apos;t fight someone who&apos;s in the same boat as you.<br /><br /><br /><img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/373697047018228084-6685821881193813571?l=themonctongrimes-dripdrain.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',1348834736,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Thu, 13 Sep 2012 15:31:00 +0000',NULL,'The Moncton Times@Transcript - Good and Bad',NULL,'...maybe they aren&apos;t lying.

And destabilized the whole world.<br /><br />Tell you what, kids, find out where Wayne Gretzky is speaking next, get out your old Oiler sweaters, and sit back and enjoy something you understand.<br /><br />There is a language issue &amp;nbsp;bubbling below the surface in New Brunswick. But it&apos;s one the francophone community has to deal with. Some of its leaders seem to be enthusiastic about the Quebec model for language. But the Quebec model has been a disaster. It has cost Quebec heavily - and things are likely to get far, far worse.<br /><br />As well, there&apos;s a great difference between Acadiens and Quebecois. Quebecois are deeply racist in the form that&apos;s called nativism. That nativism breeds and feeds on hatred- and there&apos;s no future in that. Acadiens are not Quebecois. They are not living in the same situation. They are not dealing with the same problems. What is not working in Quebec is going to be even worse in New Brunswick. And that can only hurt the Acadiens. But I don&apos;t think a committee of anglos and francos is the way to solve it. Acadiens are quite capable of dealing with their own affairs.<br /><br />NewsToday has a story, quite true, that both government and rebels are committing war &amp;nbsp;crimes in Syria. Big deal. I&apos;d like to meet anyone who can name any war in history in which both sides did not commit war crimes. In every war of the past century, the majority of victims have been civilians. And it h as been quite deliberate on all sides. Torture has been freely used. &amp;nbsp;But the only people ever charged with war crimes have been the losers.<br /><br />There are very strong and recent examples of war crimes by Britain, the US, Russia, and uncounted others. Tony Blair, former PM of the UK, is commonly described as a war criminal, even in the British Press. Bush and Obama and Blair are certainly war criminals, if only for their use of torture. So where are all the trials?<br /><br />Israel was condemned for war crimes and for abuse of human rights by the UN on many occasions. It was saved only by the US veto.(and the silence of most of our news media.)<br /><br />The only trial of note on our side was Lt. William Calley who was found guilty by a US court of murdering 112 people. (The real total of dead was closer to 800). He spent one night in jail.<br /><br />Remember the marine in Aghanistan who slaughtered 30 or so women and children, then burned their bodies? Heard much news about his trial?<br /><br />Meanwhile, Iraqis are being killed every day in large numbers. Two days ago, it was a hundred. Read much about it in the TandT? Or about the protesters shot by soldiers in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates?<br /><br />Forget war crimes trials. They&apos;re for losers. We hang a Saddam Hussein. We don&apos;t hang a Washington cabinet minister named Rumsfeld who paid him to kill Iranis.<br /><br />The only columnist worth reading on the editorial or op ed page is Alec Bruce. And he&apos;s very well worth reading. I&apos;ll just add a touch which he may or may not agree with.<br /><br />Over the past sixty years, we have seen a tremendous expansion of business moving into control of government. In fact, one observer said the American system of government had become the same as that of the Roman Empire in its last days - legalized bribery.<br /><br />That&apos;s always been a problem in Canada, too; and Harper has been encouraging the problem. Here in New Brunswick we see it with business people appointed by business leaders acting as official advisors to the government on economic policy. Corporate bosses can be extraordinarily arrogant people, actually believing that they have wide gifts to make decisions about human affairs.<br /><br />One of their decisions was to widen what we call the wage gap - the difference between incomes of the very rich and the rest of us. So we watched it widen. We watched it for thirty years.And what happened was what should have been obvious would happen.<br /><br />The very rich stored up vaults of money. Most others went downhill, and became unable to buy. Result? Recession, of course. And made worse by deregulated banks that played money games which were illegal even after deregulation. In the past month of \"recovery\", an additional million and a half Americans have slid below the poverty line. The very rich, meanwhile, sit on their vaults of money safely stored in tax havens.<br /><br />And who do they blame for this crisis? Why, it&apos;s them there poor people, expectin&apos; too much when they ain&apos;t &amp;nbsp;worth it.Yeah, I have a few billion. But I worked hard for it. Had only two billion to start, but built it up.It&apos;s mine. Ain&apos;t payin&apos; it in no taxes. You got hungry kids? Your problem. Tell you what. You give me a tax break and a government grant, and it&apos;ll all get better.<br /><br />We have lived increasingly well &amp;nbsp;for five hundred years based on the ability of a very few of us to exploit the resources and the people of all the world, the years of the western empires. Most of us never got much even in those \"good&apos; years. And now they&apos;re over. We need a new formula. We need an improved system of leadership and governance. And, as we face that, one thing is surely clear. He who has eyes to see, let &amp;nbsp;him see.<br /><br />Business leaders do not, as a group, have the competence to run any part of a society.<br /><br />Oh, skip the op ed page. That&apos;s just a lollipop with no lolli and no pop.<br /><br />Oh - a last note. This blog began a couple of years ago, drawing a hundred or so viewers a month. But things are picking up. It&apos;s now running at 5000 viewers a month and - today - it should hit a grand total of 50,000.

But it&apos;s one the francophone community has to deal with. Some of its leaders seem to be enthusiastic about the Quebec model for language. But the Quebec model has been a disaster. It has cost Quebec heavily - and things are likely to get far, far worse.<br /><br />As well, there&apos;s a great difference between Acadiens and Quebecois. Quebecois are deeply racist in the form that&apos;s called nativism. That nativism breeds and feeds on hatred- and there&apos;s no future in that. Acadiens are not Quebecois. They are not living in the same situation. They are not dealing with the same problems. What is not working in Quebec is going to be even worse in New Brunswick. And that can only hurt the Acadiens. But I don&apos;t think a committee of anglos and francos is the way to solve it. Acadiens are quite capable of dealing with their own affairs.<br /><br />NewsToday has a story, quite true, that both government and rebels are committing war &amp;nbsp;crimes in Syria. Big deal. I&apos;d like to meet anyone who can name any war in history in which both sides did not commit war crimes. In every war of the past century, the majority of victims have been civilians. And it h as been quite deliberate on all sides. Torture has been freely used. &amp;nbsp;But the only people ever charged with war crimes have been the losers.<br /><br />There are very strong and recent examples of war crimes by Britain, the US, Russia, and uncounted others. Tony Blair, former PM of the UK, is commonly described as a war criminal, even in the British Press. Bush and Obama and Blair are certainly war criminals, if only for their use of torture. So where are all the trials?<br /><br />Israel was condemned for war crimes and for abuse of human rights by the UN on many occasions. It was saved only by the US veto.(and the silence of most of our news media.)<br /><br />The only trial of note on our side was Lt. William Calley who was found guilty by a US court of murdering 112 people. (The real total of dead was closer to 800). He spent one night in jail.<br /><br />Remember the marine in Aghanistan who slaughtered 30 or so women and children, then burned their bodies? Heard much news about his trial?<br /><br />Meanwhile, Iraqis are being killed every day in large numbers. Two days ago, it was a hundred. Read much about it in the TandT? Or about the protesters shot by soldiers in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates?<br /><br />Forget war crimes trials. They&apos;re for losers. We hang a Saddam Hussein. We don&apos;t hang a Washington cabinet minister named Rumsfeld who paid him to kill Iranis.<br /><br />The only columnist worth reading on the editorial or op ed page is Alec Bruce. And he&apos;s very well worth reading. I&apos;ll just add a touch which he may or may not agree with.<br /><br />Over the past sixty years, we have seen a tremendous expansion of business moving into control of government. In fact, one observer said the American system of government had become the same as that of the Roman Empire in its last days - legalized bribery.<br /><br />That&apos;s always been a problem in Canada, too; and Harper has been encouraging the problem. Here in New Brunswick we see it with business people appointed by business leaders acting as official advisors to the government on economic policy. Corporate bosses can be extraordinarily arrogant people, actually believing that they have wide gifts to make decisions about human affairs.<br /><br />One of their decisions was to widen what we call the wage gap - the difference between incomes of the very rich and the rest of us. So we watched it widen. We watched it for thirty years.And what happened was what should have been obvious would happen.<br /><br />The very rich stored up vaults of money. Most others went downhill, and became unable to buy. Result? Recession, of course. And made worse by deregulated banks that played money games which were illegal even after deregulation. In the past month of \"recovery\", an additional million and a half Americans have slid below the poverty line. The very rich, meanwhile, sit on their vaults of money safely stored in tax havens.<br /><br />And who do they blame for this crisis? Why, it&apos;s them there poor people, expectin&apos; too much when they ain&apos;t &amp;nbsp;worth it.Yeah, I have a few billion. But I worked hard for it. Had only two billion to start, but built it up.It&apos;s mine. Ain&apos;t payin&apos; it in no taxes. You got hungry kids? Your problem. Tell you what. You give me a tax break and a government grant, and it&apos;ll all get better.<br /><br />We have lived increasingly well &amp;nbsp;for five hundred years based on the ability of a very few of us to exploit the resources and the people of all the world, the years of the western empires. Most of us never got much even in those \"good&apos; years. And now they&apos;re over. We need a new formula. We need an improved system of leadership and governance. And, as we face that, one thing is surely clear. He who has eyes to see, let &amp;nbsp;him see.<br /><br />Business leaders do not, as a group, have the competence to run any part of a society.<br /><br />Oh, skip the op ed page. That&apos;s just a lollipop with no lolli and no pop.<br /><br />Oh - a last note. This blog began a couple of years ago, drawing a hundred or so viewers a month. But things are picking up.

I mean, you put all those people together, and they could&amp;nbsp;easily pony up enough of their money and borrow enough more to build that rink - and then to keep for themselves all the huge profits that the rink will surely generate. But no, they want us to have all that profit. I kiss the ground those saints walk on.<br /><br />Oh, and Mayor Leblanc will be there to answer questions, so everything will be clear and out in the open.<br /><br />And Gretzky should be ashamed of himself.

That&apos;s probably more dangerous for Obama than it is for Romney because Obama last time had the advantage of being the image of hope. And he has certainly left that image in ashes.<br /><br />But it&apos;s even more dangerous for the nation. Political trust, belief in democracy are the lowest they have ever been in the US. This is coupled with massive unemployment, and low wages for those who do get jobs. And it&apos;s going to get worse, much worse. The major response of government so far has been to militarize the police in both equipment and training, to set up a domestic espionage system that is the most extensive in history with files on the private lives of virtually all Americans (and more than a few of us), with the extension of powers to imprison American citizens with no charge or trial - even to assassinate them on presidential order - and with torture the flavour of the day.<br /><br />The spying is often illegal; and it concentrates on African Americans, hispanics, anyone who looks different.<br /><br />The reality is that the US is a police state. It&apos;s not going that way. It&apos;s not showing tendencies. It has happened. &amp;nbsp; All that remains uncertain is how long it can maintain even a facade of democracy.

I mean, like, do you really think he&apos;s just here to see the tidal bore and maybe dine out at a Big Stop?<br /><br />And they&apos;re so good to us. I mean, you put all those people together, and they could&amp;nbsp;easily pony up enough of their money and borrow enough more to build that rink - and then to keep for themselves all the huge profits that the rink will surely generate. But no, they want us to have all that profit. I kiss the ground those saints walk on.<br /><br />Oh, and Mayor Leblanc will be there to answer questions, so everything will be clear and out in the open.<br /><br />And Gretzky should be ashamed of himself. (The others won&apos;t be. If they were capable of shame they wouldn&apos;t be partners to this scam.)<br /><br />If you read just a little bit between the lines of Alec Bruce&apos;s column, few Americans are crazy about either of their political parties. That&apos;s probably more dangerous for Obama than it is for Romney because Obama last time had the advantage of being the image of hope. And he has certainly left that image in ashes.<br /><br />But it&apos;s even more dangerous for the nation. Political trust, belief in democracy are the lowest they have ever been in the US. This is coupled with massive unemployment, and low wages for those who do get jobs. And it&apos;s going to get worse, much worse. The major response of government so far has been to militarize the police in both equipment and training, to set up a domestic espionage system that is the most extensive in history with files on the private lives of virtually all Americans (and more than a few of us), with the extension of powers to imprison American citizens with no charge or trial - even to assassinate them on presidential order - and with torture the flavour of the day.<br /><br />The spying is often illegal; and it concentrates on African Americans, hispanics, anyone who looks different.<br /><br />The reality is that the US is a police state. It&apos;s not going that way. It&apos;s not showing tendencies. It has happened. &amp;nbsp; All that remains uncertain is how long it can maintain even a facade of democracy. Oh, and how long we will remain a democracy - if we still are.<br /><br />The op ed page is the usual dead loss. It, alone, is free of any danger of being spied on.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/373697047018228084-7286486862637733387?l=themonctongrimes-dripdrain.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'Opinion','Opinion',NULL),(327,0,0,'Sept. 9: more lying?','text/html','http://themonctongrimes-dripdrain.blogspot.com/2012/09/sept-9-more-lying.html','City',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-09 10:45:13',17,'There&apos;s a remarkable story that is not in Saturday TandT - though it has appeared in papers around the world.

So why didn&apos;t the TandT, like The Globe and other newspapers around the world mention it?<br /><br />Putin told Harper that the two year sentence of the Pussy Riot girls for blasphemy in a church had high support from the Russian people - and even more so because Pussy riot had just shortly before that staged a group sex show at a Moscow Museum.<br /><br />Now, Putin in not a nice guy. He rose by dint of a career of murder, torture and brutality. It&apos;s quite possible, even probable, he ordered those prison terms.

There are, I&apos;m afraid, few nice buys on either side.<br /><br />Now, if Pussy Riot did put on a group sex performance, and if the general public in Russia knew about it and was profoundly offended (and it if was on facebook), how come we never heard about it?

The Reality is that Pussy Riot could well have received two years in any Canadian or American court for a similar crime. &amp;nbsp;For example:<br /><br />An American woman who served in the military turned against the Afghanistan war based on what she had seen. She came to Canada for refuge. Harper, his nose never far from the bottom of an American president, ordered her deported. She faces separation from her child, and a prison sentence.

( But there are plenty of Canadian foolish enough to take them seriously.) He says Iran is the most serious threat to world peace. Let&apos;s see.....<br /><br />Iran has not attacked anybody in over a century. It has no capacity to launch attacks much beyond its borders even if if did have plans to attack. Far from attacking others, it has been attacked in the past century by Britain, then by Britain, and the US who overthrew its democratically elected government to install a dictator; then by Iraq&apos;s Saddam who attacked with major support from western Europe and the US in a war that killed over a million. The motive in all cases was the same, to plunder Iran&apos;s oil fields, and make huge profits for those nice people in the oil industry.<br /><br />Israel has been calling for an attack on Iran for at least ten years, always saying that Iran is just a month from getting a nuclear bomb. (What the hell. If people are so stupid as to believe a lie repeated so often, who can blame Israel for repeating it?) In fact, and despite all the misleading stories in our hack journalism world, there is no evidence that Iran is even planning to develop a nuclear bomb.<br /><br />Iran is the biggest threat to world peace? Not China which is threatening Japan and Taiwan and is widening its sphere of influence? &amp;nbsp;Not Russia which was the evil one for so many years? Not Pakistan which has been the world&apos;s biggest proliferator of nuclear weapons? Not the US which has killed somewhere well over four million people in Asia, Central America, the Middle East, and Afghanistan and Africa in the last seventy years? And which is fighting a war of aggression now against Afghanistan as well as unadvertised wars in Yemen, Somalia, and nobody knows how many other places? &amp;nbsp;And which is the world&apos;s largest supplier of weapons and torture implements?<br /><br />Iran is threatening Israel? Israel has been demanding a war against Iran for ten years, and has routinely murdered Iranian scientists over that time.<br /><br />There are a lot of aggressive and heavily-armed nations out there - China, Russia, the US, Britain, France, Pakistan, India, Israel - and they have thousands of nuclear weapons. &amp;nbsp;Iran has &amp;nbsp;a navy that can barely handle coastal patrols, an air force with no long range capacity, no nuclear weapons, and no long range missile ability. And Harper says this is the most dangerous country in the world. The US has over 500 military bases all over the world;and has been at war almost constantly &amp;nbsp;for the lifetimes of most readers. &amp;nbsp;But that&apos;s good. That&apos;s to spread peace and democracy. Like when they slaughtered a quarter million civilians in Guatemala to install a dictatorship.<br /><br />Oh - I forgot. Iran is guilty of human right abuses. Wow! Torture on our side doesn&apos;t count? Not even when the Canadian government hands over Canadian&amp;nbsp;citizens to be tortured? The mass murder of a quarter milllion Guatemalans doesn&apos;t count? The use of drones to kill indiscriminately and illegally in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia doesn&apos;t count? Guantanamo doesn&apos;t count?<br /><br />Harper doesn&apos;t give a damn about threats to world peace or about human rights abuses. He&apos;s proven that he doesn&apos;t give a damn. He happily turned over Canadian citizens for torture at the hands of the US. Canada is the only western country that did not demand that it&apos;s citizens captured in Afghanistan be returned for fair trial. So what&apos;s this all about? And why is Harper playing such a leading role?<br /><br />Part of the answer is that Harper depends heavily on the Israeli lobby to get out the Jewish vote. Though many Jewish Canadians are no great admirers of the Israeli lobby, it has lots of money and influence. (Yes, Virginia, there is an Israeli lobby in Canada, the US and other countries - and it has lots and lots of money to buy support and spread propaganda for Netanyahu.)<br /><br />The break in relations will have no effect on Iran. So why is the Harper government lying so hard? (And the break will have no effect on the US plan to attack Iran. The war was long ago decided on by the US oil industry which is picking up the tabs for both the Democrats and the Republicans. (It&apos;s like New Brunswick that way.) Obama is trying to delay the war, not to avoid it.<br /><br />So why the lying and posturing?<br /><br />This can only be a guess. Two people stand to gain from our announcement.

Harper has pretty well committed us to help out with the slaughter. So much for parliament deciding on war.<br /><br />It&apos;s quite likely that Canadians will die, too - just as they died in Afghanistan \"to protect our freedom and spread democracy.\"<br /><br />In my teaching days, I taught at least one military history course every year. Many of the students were militiamen and women who were planning for military careers. They were good students, admirable people, and highly idealistic. They were proud of their uniforms, and had a high sense of the honour of military service.<br /><br />I often wonder how they feel now that they have been used to bomb Libya, to kill in Afghanistan, to hand over people for torture, to inflict starvation and unspeakable hardships on millions of people....<br /><br />Now, Mr. Harper, from the comfort of his office in Ottawa, will send them off to kill and be killed not only in &amp;nbsp;Iran but in the impossible to predict effects of the war&apos;s spread out of control, and even into a world war.<br /><br />But not to worry. On Nov. 11, a year from now, some stuffed shirt will step up to a microphone to say how grateful we are to our young people for giving their lives to protect Canadian freedom.<br /><br />And I&apos;m sure the leaders of the oil industry will second those kind words.<br /><br />Neither Canada nor Harper has ever sunk so low.

On Nov. 11, a year from now, some stuffed shirt will step up to a microphone to say how grateful we are to our young people for giving their lives to protect Canadian freedom.<br /><br />And I&apos;m sure the leaders of the oil industry will second those kind words.<br /><br />Neither Canada nor Harper has ever sunk so low. I&apos;m ashamed to be a Canadian.<br /><br />p.s. As I expected, The TandT simply planted the story in C section as a story of no great distinction.

It said so right there on the front page of The Moncton Times and Tribune. It&apos;s an up-to-the minute fast-breaking story on p.1 that carries over to p. 2. &amp;nbsp;And, get a grip on yourselves, folks, there&apos;s another huge story on p. 3 with big pictures of the new U de Moncton cafeteria and it has tables and chairs and everythng.<br /><br />P. 1 has another big story. They&apos;re still building the the Mapleton Shopping Centre. And they&apos;ve got pictures to prove it. Boy. This is a paper that really digs to get at the truth.<br /><br />There&apos;s also a sad story on p. 1. Moncton needs a hospice to provide close to a million dollars a year to help &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;terminally ill people - some 120 a year - die in care and dignity. Most of it has to be done by charity. &amp;nbsp;And that&apos;s reasonable. Most of our government money is tied up in building an expensive new high school out of town; and the government has to put aside a hundred million for a hockey rink - not to mention the problem of keeping taxes down for our aristocracy, and making sure they get lots of nice, road contracts.<br /><br />It&apos;s a situation a lot like the bus drivers. The bus drivers aren&apos;t worth it. The terminally ill aren&apos;t worth it, either. Screw&apos;em.<br /><br />The news reports on Quebec aren&apos;t much use because they come from PostMedia which doesn&apos;t know a whole lot about Quebec. The election night shooting is &amp;nbsp;scarcely the first incident of political violence in Quebec. &amp;nbsp;I can well remember bombs going off in mail boxes that stood in anglo districts. I remember a policeman killed in one of those incidents. I can remember separatist heroes who kidnapped and murdered a cabinet minister.<br /><br />They were captured - and all got light sentences. One day, not many &amp;nbsp;years later as I entered a French/English college at which I was to speak. There was a man behind me. I held the door for him. He was the leader of the kidnappers, and almost certainly the one who had strangled cabinet minister Pierre Laporte. He had been invited to the school as a hero to address a school assembly.<br /><br />Nobody said he was deranged or dangerous or any of that. Somehow, I don&apos;t think James Bain will be as lucky.<br /><br />\"The Language Debate\" is the great red herring of Quebec polititics. It easily stirs up emotions and hatreds, and that makes it useful for Quebec political leaders (all of them) who don&apos;t want to deal with the real issues.<br /><br />Issue 1 - Quebec society is closer to the seventeenth century than the twenty-first. It is run by a privileged class of francophones, the ones who can afford to send their children to excellent and expensive private schools. Every premier of Quebec but one has come from those private schools (and the one attended such a school but didn&apos;t finish.) Almost all cabinet ministers and professionals come out of those schools. And those schools all provide superb training in bilingualism. They are what produced a Trudeau.<br /><br />Historically, francophone public schools &amp;nbsp;of Quebec have been for the riff-raff. Until recently, one couldn&apos;t even enter university from them. And they still offer appallingly bad instruction in English. That&apos;s deliberate. It keeps the wealthier francophones in their positions of power and wealth by condemning the working class to remain forever a working class.<br /><br />And why is it important for francophones in Quebec to be bilingual? That takes us to the other, ignored reality.<br /><br />2. Quebec lives by doing business, primarily with Canada and the United States. Its big corporations like Bombardier and SNC-Lavalin do business globally - where the prevailing language is English. A PQ government once warned Bombardier that it must use French in its work. Bombardier said it has to get engineers and other specialists from all over the world - and they speak English. It told the government to get stuffed. And just to rub the point home, it bought a large property just over the border in upstate New York, and threatened to move there. You will have noticed that Mrs. Marois proposed tough laws to make small businesses work in French. She didn&apos;t say a word about Lavalin or Bombardier.<br /><br />It may not be fair. But it&apos;s a reality. Quebec, separate or Canadian, has to do business with a largely English world. It has to be broadly bilingual if most French are going to improve their status. Holland has the same problem, though on a much larger scale. When I taught there, I learned that most Dutch could speak French, English, German, and commonly Spanish and Italian. All of them well. Papers written for me in French or English were done so well that they seemed to have been written by native French and English rather than by Dutch students. (and I did not see any loss of Dutch culture.)<br /><br />But it&apos;s not going to happen in Quebec - largely because if it did, the rich francophones who also dominate the political leadership would lose their privileged position. Instead, Marois fought a campaign to fan the hysteria over language, and to spread fear and hatred. It&apos;s an old game in Quebec. And it works every time.<br /><br />For forty years and more, Quebec political leaders have warned about the danger of Quebeckers learning English. And they all have had one thing in common. They all speak excellent English.<br /><br />The great danger facing Quebec is that it has no political leadership willing to face the realities of what Quebec needs. That will produce at least one of two results in the near future. One is a Parti-Quebecois that will continue to feed on fear and hatred. The other, even more dangerous, is a general population, angry and frustrated without knowing exactly why, will turn loose against government in general. It&apos;s going to be a bumpy ride.<br /><br />But don&apos;t expect to get any sense of that from the pages of The Moncton Times and Transcript.<br /><br />The lead editorial wants to get city buses back on the road. Well, yes. But there&apos;s an even bigger problem behind that one. According to Citigroup ( not a fanatical, bomb-throwing group of environmentalists, but an investment house) Saudi Arabia will run out of oil by 2030. That&apos;s just eighteen years away. And it&apos;s not the only place that&apos;s running dry. And, it&apos;s happening at a time when world demand is skyrocketing.<br /><br />There&apos;s a reason why oil companies are scrounging for dirty oil as in Alberta, for oil in risky places like the Arctic and the sea bottoms, and for shale gas with all its proven dangers. We are in serious trouble for energy supply. And gas is going to become very, very expensive, very, very, very soon.<br /><br />So, the editorial writer would like to get those buses going again. So would I. But that is one hell of a short term solution. How are we going to move people and goods ten years from now? Maybe five years. Maybe less. What are our far-sighted city planners doing, (when they aren&apos;t doodling pictures of an events centre with a five thousand car parking lot, and putting parking meters on Main St.?<br /><br />From what I can see, the bus company employees are worth the pay they want. The city planners aren&apos;t. Nor is most of the council worth the cost of its janitorial services.<br /><br />There&apos;s also a very scarey column by Gwynne Dyer that planners and councillors might want to think about. I know Moncton is the hub of the universe - but if climate changes as Dyer suggests it is doing, it might have serious implications for the plan of Moncton - and in the very near future.<br /><br />A quite decent column by Norbert but, oh, Norbert. Our public school systems don&apos;t come from England. They come from Scotland. And the Scots were not learning to read and write &amp;nbsp;100 years ago; it was more like 300. It was Scots, raised in Gaelic, who learned English to teach the English how to read. Got a Bible from 1800 or so lying around the house? It&apos;s probably Gaelic. The Presbyterian church insisted on literacy so everybody would read The Bible, and think about it. The English went to Anglican churches because there they weren&apos;t required to read or think.<br /><br />On the op ed page, Jody Dallaire is worth a read. Rod Allen -and this seems to be a characteristic of the staff writers at the TandT - is irrelevant. It there&apos;s a story here, I can&apos;t find it. If it&apos;s an attempt to be funny, it&apos;s bloody feeble. How can a man spend so long in Journalism - and have so little to say about anything?<br /><br />There&apos;s a good letter to the editor about Crandall University and how, despite defying the law by discriminating against gays, it gets $150,000 from the city of Moncton. 150 grand a year. That would be a big step to supporting a terminal care centre for the city. But I can&apos;t help noticing that city council has been remarkably silent on this issue. It makes you wonder. Who had the muscle to get that 150,000 - and to keep it coming after all the criticism?<br /><br />If the council won&apos;t tell us, perhaps Crandall will. As Baptists, aren&apos;t they committed to telling the truth? Or is discriminating against gays the only part of the The Cospel they have to obey? (Actually, it&apos;s not in the Gospels).<br /><br /><br /><img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/373697047018228084-7856540507131788934?l=themonctongrimes-dripdrain.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',1348834740,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Thu, 06 Sep 2012 15:41:00 +0000',NULL,'The Moncton Times@Transcript - Good and Bad',NULL,'...yes, it did.

That will produce at least one of two results in the near future. One is a Parti-Quebecois that will continue to feed on fear and hatred. The other, even more dangerous, is a general population, angry and frustrated without knowing exactly why, will turn loose against government in general. It&apos;s going to be a bumpy ride.<br /><br />But don&apos;t expect to get any sense of that from the pages of The Moncton Times and Transcript.<br /><br />The lead editorial wants to get city buses back on the road. Well, yes. But there&apos;s an even bigger problem behind that one. According to Citigroup ( not a fanatical, bomb-throwing group of environmentalists, but an investment house) Saudi Arabia will run out of oil by 2030. That&apos;s just eighteen years away. And it&apos;s not the only place that&apos;s running dry. And, it&apos;s happening at a time when world demand is skyrocketing.<br /><br />There&apos;s a reason why oil companies are scrounging for dirty oil as in Alberta, for oil in risky places like the Arctic and the sea bottoms, and for shale gas with all its proven dangers. We are in serious trouble for energy supply. And gas is going to become very, very expensive, very, very, very soon.<br /><br />So, the editorial writer would like to get those buses going again. So would I. But that is one hell of a short term solution. How are we going to move people and goods ten years from now? Maybe five years. Maybe less. What are our far-sighted city planners doing, (when they aren&apos;t doodling pictures of an events centre with a five thousand car parking lot, and putting parking meters on Main St.?<br /><br />From what I can see, the bus company employees are worth the pay they want. The city planners aren&apos;t. Nor is most of the council worth the cost of its janitorial services.<br /><br />There&apos;s also a very scarey column by Gwynne Dyer that planners and councillors might want to think about. I know Moncton is the hub of the universe - but if climate changes as Dyer suggests it is doing, it might have serious implications for the plan of Moncton - and in the very near future.<br /><br />A quite decent column by Norbert but, oh, Norbert. Our public school systems don&apos;t come from England. They come from Scotland. And the Scots were not learning to read and write &amp;nbsp;100 years ago; it was more like 300. It was Scots, raised in Gaelic, who learned English to teach the English how to read. Got a Bible from 1800 or so lying around the house? It&apos;s probably Gaelic. The Presbyterian church insisted on literacy so everybody would read The Bible, and think about it. The English went to Anglican churches because there they weren&apos;t required to read or think.<br /><br />On the op ed page, Jody Dallaire is worth a read. Rod Allen -and this seems to be a characteristic of the staff writers at the TandT - is irrelevant. It there&apos;s a story here, I can&apos;t find it. If it&apos;s an attempt to be funny, it&apos;s bloody feeble. How can a man spend so long in Journalism - and have so little to say about anything?<br /><br />There&apos;s a good letter to the editor about Crandall University and how, despite defying the law by discriminating against gays, it gets $150,000 from the city of Moncton. 150 grand a year. That would be a big step to supporting a terminal care centre for the city. But I can&apos;t help noticing that city council has been remarkably silent on this issue. It makes you wonder. Who had the muscle to get that 150,000 - and to keep it coming after all the criticism?<br /><br />If the council won&apos;t tell us, perhaps Crandall will. As Baptists, aren&apos;t they committed to telling the truth? Or is discriminating against gays the only part of the The Cospel they have to obey? (Actually, it&apos;s not in the Gospels).<br /><br /><br /><img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/373697047018228084-7856540507131788934?l=themonctongrimes-dripdrain.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'Opinion','Opinion',NULL),(331,0,0,'Sept. 5:  Page one....','text/html','http://themonctongrimes-dripdrain.blogspot.com/2012/09/sept-5-page-one.html','City',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-05 08:55:04',17,'In most newspapers, page one is for the big news of the day.

The PQ is running almost entirely on anti-English bigotry and hysteria. The Liberal party (like most previous governments in Quebec) is up to its ears in corruption. The other parties, like the previous two, are nowhere close to any analysis of Quebec&apos;s real problems - let along having any solution.<br /><br />That means the election could leave us with an increasingly angry and dissatisfied Quebec population- and with a demonstrated predisposition to violence.

It&apos;s essential to us not only for fresh water (which is about to become a very scarce commodity), but also to absorb carbon emissions and so to slow down global warming. And it has already suffered damage from the oilsands project.<br /><br />And what will Mr. Harper do? Well, he&apos;s made that pretty clear. Oil comes first. He continues to ram through oil projects. Tomorrow will be somebody else&apos;s problem. If there is a tomorrow.<br /><br />The T and T also has the story on Obama cooling off Netanyahu on any ideas of attacking Iran. (The story is a week old, but, what the hell, they got it at last.) It began when Obama sharply reduced the American forces taking part in a military exercise with Israeli forces. That wiped out any hope Netanyahu had of having a large American force on hand for the attack.<br /><br />Suddenly, Netanyahu and his favourite news media have stopped beating the drum for war which he obviously wanted to start before the US election. Obviously, Obama has warned him. This comes as a great relief to US military chiefs, Israeli military chiefs,, Israeli intelligence, and the majority of Israelis. many of whom think Netanyahu is so wildly unrealistic as to be dangerous. &amp;nbsp;But do we care in Moncton?<br /><br />Maybe not. But we should. An attack on Iran now would show us what a real gasoline crisis looks like - and maybe even what a real world war looks like.<br /><br />The report doesn&apos;t come close to being a full one, of course. That&apos;s because it&apos;s from Reuters, the TandT&apos;s only source of foreign news.<br /><br />Oh, Reuters plays its usual game of demonizing government soldiers in Syria. \"Syrian army destroys houses.\"<br />Yes, it does. What does Reuters think other armies do - give out chocolate bars and build schools for little girls?<br /><br />The deliberate destruction of houses and the deliberate killing of civilians has become a major purpose of war for ALL countries since the invention of HE artillery and the aerial bomber. In World War Two, the US deliberately firebombed wooden cities in Japan, causing more deaths that the nuclear bombs did.<br /><br />There was the deliberate bombing of civilians in Camodia that killed a half a million. There was the deliberate bombing of civilians in Vietnam that killed millions. Remember the Iraq war and the special attention to Falujah, the city where people die and babies are born with horrible defects from depleted uranium that the city was shelled with? There are drones daily fired at countries we are not at war with - Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia - and they are killing large numbers of civilians. (But don&apos;t worry about. it. The TandT doesn&apos;t think it important enough to mention.)<br /><br />Yes. The Syrian army does terrible things. But neither we nor Syrians rebels are the ones to point self-righteous fingers.<br /><br />And the missing story?<br /><br />Arctic ice is disappearing at a much faster rate than earlier realized. And that has greatly accelerated the pace of global warming. But neither Canada nor the US has taken significant steps to deal with global warming. And they&apos;re not going to, not so long as there&apos;s an oil industry. )Duh, yeah, duh, I know we&apos;ll destroy the earth. But, duh, it could create some good jobs for a while.)<br /><br />A6 and A7 are all pictures - of people smiling, jumping, etc. on Labour Day. Real newspapers for grownups don&apos;t do that. The implication is clear - and it happens often - the TandT thinks its buyers are too stupid to read. So give them lots of pictures, irrelevant pictures. It&apos;s cheap. It fills space. And it says nothing whatever. &amp;nbsp;And once again, the TandT gets through a&amp;nbsp;whole Labour Day weekend without ever mentioning what it&apos;s about.<br /><br />How about we rename it Irving Day? Boy, then it would get serious coverage.<br /><br />On the op ed page, Alan Cochrane tells us a story about the Dieppe Raid. But what he tells us is a story that the paper has already carried at least twice - and he has nothing new to add. This is the story that the raid was really a success because it was a cover for a commando raid to get vital information. All Cochrane does is to add mistakes. In Fleming, for example, was not \"the top\" British intelligence officer. In fact, he was widely regarded as a bit of a kook in the intelligence service.<br /><br />And if there was such a special group, the Canadians could have been landed at a better spot so that half of them would not have been killed or captured. Nor was there any point in landing them at all after the Germans realized they were on their way. It was not a brilliant tactic. It was a costly blunder.<br /><br />In the middle of his article, Cochrane does say \"I have trouble &amp;nbsp;believing the entire attack was staged for just a \"pinch raid.\" \" But then he spends the rest of the article believing it.<br /><br />And again, in a Canada full of military historians, he does not ask any of them for their reactions. Tell you what, Allan, I could give you a list of names - and how to get in touch with them.<br /><br />Oh, and think about this sentence. \"The historian..... spent fifteen years digging through war documents that were just recently declassified by the British government.\" &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ???????<br /><br />If there were \"just recently\" declassified, how could he have spent fifteen years digging through them?<br /><br />But above all people at the TandT should learn to ask questions - from people who know what they&apos;re talking about (which means not people who are the usual academic hacks they ask.)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/373697047018228084-6665344195534145752?l=themonctongrimes-dripdrain.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',1348834741,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Tue, 04 Sep 2012 15:26:00 +0000',NULL,'The Moncton Times@Transcript - Good and Bad',NULL,'Last night, I was studying the major news stories for today.

But we should. An attack on Iran now would show us what a real gasoline crisis looks like - and maybe even what a real world war looks like.<br /><br />The report doesn&apos;t come close to being a full one, of course. That&apos;s because it&apos;s from Reuters, the TandT&apos;s only source of foreign news.<br /><br />Oh, Reuters plays its usual game of demonizing government soldiers in Syria. \"Syrian army destroys houses.\"<br />Yes, it does. What does Reuters think other armies do - give out chocolate bars and build schools for little girls?<br /><br />The deliberate destruction of houses and the deliberate killing of civilians has become a major purpose of war for ALL countries since the invention of HE artillery and the aerial bomber. In World War Two, the US deliberately firebombed wooden cities in Japan, causing more deaths that the nuclear bombs did.<br /><br />There was the deliberate bombing of civilians in Camodia that killed a half a million. There was the deliberate bombing of civilians in Vietnam that killed millions. Remember the Iraq war and the special attention to Falujah, the city where people die and babies are born with horrible defects from depleted uranium that the city was shelled with? There are drones daily fired at countries we are not at war with - Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia - and they are killing large numbers of civilians. (But don&apos;t worry about. it. The TandT doesn&apos;t think it important enough to mention.)<br /><br />Yes. The Syrian army does terrible things. But neither we nor Syrians rebels are the ones to point self-righteous fingers.<br /><br />And the missing story?<br /><br />Arctic ice is disappearing at a much faster rate than earlier realized. And that has greatly accelerated the pace of global warming. But neither Canada nor the US has taken significant steps to deal with global warming. And they&apos;re not going to, not so long as there&apos;s an oil industry. )Duh, yeah, duh, I know we&apos;ll destroy the earth. But, duh, it could create some good jobs for a while.)<br /><br />A6 and A7 are all pictures - of people smiling, jumping, etc. on Labour Day. Real newspapers for grownups don&apos;t do that. The implication is clear - and it happens often - the TandT thinks its buyers are too stupid to read. So give them lots of pictures, irrelevant pictures. It&apos;s cheap. It fills space. And it says nothing whatever. &amp;nbsp;And once again, the TandT gets through a&amp;nbsp;whole Labour Day weekend without ever mentioning what it&apos;s about.<br /><br />How about we rename it Irving Day? Boy, then it would get serious coverage.<br /><br />On the op ed page, Alan Cochrane tells us a story about the Dieppe Raid. But what he tells us is a story that the paper has already carried at least twice - and he has nothing new to add. This is the story that the raid was really a success because it was a cover for a commando raid to get vital information. All Cochrane does is to add mistakes. In Fleming, for example, was not \"the top\" British intelligence officer. In fact, he was widely regarded as a bit of a kook in the intelligence service.<br /><br />And if there was such a special group, the Canadians could have been landed at a better spot so that half of them would not have been killed or captured. Nor was there any point in landing them at all after the Germans realized they were on their way. It was not a brilliant tactic. It was a costly blunder.<br /><br />In the middle of his article, Cochrane does say \"I have trouble &amp;nbsp;believing the entire attack was staged for just a \"pinch raid.\" \" But then he spends the rest of the article believing it.<br /><br />And again, in a Canada full of military historians, he does not ask any of them for their reactions. Tell you what, Allan, I could give you a list of names - and how to get in touch with them.<br /><br />Oh, and think about this sentence. \"The historian..... spent fifteen years digging through war documents that were just recently declassified by the British government.\" &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ???????<br /><br />If there were \"just recently\" declassified, how could he have spent fifteen years digging through them?<br /><br />But above all people at the TandT should learn to ask questions - from people who know what they&apos;re talking about (which means not people who are the usual academic hacks they ask.)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/373697047018228084-6665344195534145752?l=themonctongrimes-dripdrain.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'Opinion','Opinion',NULL),(333,0,0,'Sept. 27: What the hell is going on?','text/html','http://themonctongrimes-dripdrain.blogspot.com/2012/09/sept-27-what-hell-is-going-on.html','City',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-27 08:35:22',17,'Yesterday, de Adder had a pretty simple-minded cartoon critical of the government for its language discussions.<br />Today, de Adder had a pretty simple-minded cartoon critical of the government for its language discussions.<br />(He has never had a cartoon about its secrecy in dealing with shale gas.)<br /><br />Yesterday, the TandT had a long story about a political party of almost no following that is critical of language duality in New Brunswick.<br /><br />Today,(p.

Perhaps this is not too shocking, considering that the Liberals are still leaderless (and more so than usual, Bob Rae has not been very visible of late).<br /><br />It is worth noting that Abacus used Angus-Reid&apos;s online panel for their polling. Based on the information available in their report, it would appear that Abacus recorded, or at least released, more demographic results than Angus-Reid ever does: Conservatives lead among evangelicals while the NDP leads among non-religious people, for example.

The Bloc appears to be benefiting slightly from the PQ&apos;s recent election victory.<br /><br />Alberta and Atlantic Canada had some statistically significant swings. In Alberta, the Conservatives dropped 12 points to 58% while the NDP was up 15 points to 29%. The Liberals fell nine points to 6%.

The Liberals manage only nine in the province, and appear to be somewhat penalized by the new boundaries. On the old map, the Conservatives would win 71 seats, the NDP 25, and the Liberals 10 in the province.<br /><br />The New Democrats do very well in British Columbia and the Prairies, but also manage to win four of the 34 seats in Alberta.

Marc Garneau, a likely candidate for leadership, has a favourability of 26% to 15% unfavourable. He has very high \"neutral\" and \"don&apos;t know\" numbers.<br /><br />Among Liberal supporters, Trudeau has a 70% favourability rating, with only 9% saying they have an unfavourable opinion of him. At 7%, Garneau&apos;s unfavourability among Liberals is lower, but so is his favourability rating: 51%.

I think Rick is expressing a frustration that a lot of people have with polling right now, but I also think this is being borne out of a bit of a false narrative when it comes to polling. He refers to Alberta, Quebec, and the disappearance of the Bloc as things the polls got wrong. I&apos;ll give him Alberta - that was a disaster. But the problem in Quebec was rather minimal: underscoring the Liberals by a few points in polls taken a few days before the vote. That was hardly a catastrophe. It&apos;s not as if the polls said that QuÃ©bec Solidaire would win 20% of the vote and the CAQ would form a majority government. The PQ won with a minority, as most of the final polls suggested was a strong possibility.<br /><br />And the polls did not miss out on the Bloc - the final four polls of the federal campaign averaged 24.6% for the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois in Quebec, instead of their actual result of 23.4%. Perhaps Rick is referring to a site like mine that did not predict that the Bloc would win only four seats, but I don&apos;t think it is fair to say that the polls missed out on the Bloc&apos;s demise.<br /><br />This is something I have heard again and again, that the polls did not anticipate the NDP&apos;s rise in Quebec and the Bloc&apos;s fall. They absolutely did anticipate these things. They didn&apos;t see it coming two or three weeks before the vote, but that is because Quebecers hadn&apos;t swung over to the NDP yet. Polls don&apos;t predict future events, opinions ebb and flow during a campaign and we have seen many examples of that over the past 16 months. But critics of polls never point out their successes, even their recent ones: very good results in Quebec during the federal campaign, a perfect call in Manitoba&apos;s election, good performances in Ontario and Saskatchewan, and decent individual polls in Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland &amp;amp; Labrador. Sure, Alberta was a Dewey-defeats-Truman moment and they could have been better in Quebec, but let&apos;s not throw the baby out with the bathwater.

The PQ won with a minority, as most of the final polls suggested was a strong possibility.<br /><br />And the polls did not miss out on the Bloc - the final four polls of the federal campaign averaged 24.6% for the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois in Quebec, instead of their actual result of 23.4%. Perhaps Rick is referring to a site like mine that did not predict that the Bloc would win only four seats, but I don&apos;t think it is fair to say that the polls missed out on the Bloc&apos;s demise.<br /><br />This is something I have heard again and again, that the polls did not anticipate the NDP&apos;s rise in Quebec and the Bloc&apos;s fall. They absolutely did anticipate these things. They didn&apos;t see it coming two or three weeks before the vote, but that is because Quebecers hadn&apos;t swung over to the NDP yet. Polls don&apos;t predict future events, opinions ebb and flow during a campaign and we have seen many examples of that over the past 16 months. But critics of polls never point out their successes, even their recent ones: very good results in Quebec during the federal campaign, a perfect call in Manitoba&apos;s election, good performances in Ontario and Saskatchewan, and decent individual polls in Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland &amp;amp; Labrador. Sure, Alberta was a Dewey-defeats-Truman moment and they could have been better in Quebec, but let&apos;s not throw the baby out with the bathwater. And that&apos;s my counter-rant.<img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/623376556094758746-274508584848658022?l=www.threehundredeight.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'News','News',NULL),(337,0,0,'National Post: Plagiarism is Okay Because Free Press is Accountable to No One','text/html','http://sixthestate.net/?p=6627','Media;Canada',NULL,NULL,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,14,'High-profile Globe &#38; Mail columnist Margaret Wente, whose habitual plagiarizing made the news this week after her employer tried unsucessfully to dismiss allegations by bloggers, has picked up yet another defender from amongst the bloated, hypocritical ranks of the professional media circus.

Journalists are increasingly at the mercy of a \"public editor\" who sits outside the editorial department.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Oh, sweet Christ. The blogosphere didn&#8217;t &#8220;define&#8221; plagiarism. Plagiarism was already defined for us, when we went to school. I know you went to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Corcoran\">a second-rate institution</a> with the endearing nickname of Last Chance U, but I&#8217;m sure it must have come up even there. It&#8217;s a fairly simple principle: if you&#8217;re using someone else&#8217;s words, attribute them. You seem to think this is some random, arbitrary, unfair principle. It isn&#8217;t. You&#8217;re a newspaper columnist. The sole reason you get paid is because people (apparently) want to know what you have to say. If you&#8217;re printing words that were actually written by someone else, and then getting paid for them&#8230; are you honestly telling me you see no problem with this?</p>\n<p>The most disturbing part of it all, though, is the sneering condescension. What Corcoran is telling us, and he hasn&#8217;t been the only one in recent days, is that the media is accountable to no one. It will make &#8212; and break &#8212; its own rules. Readers have no right to expect that when they open the Globe &amp; Mail or the National Post, the words they find there were actually penned by a professional journalist rather than copied-and-pasted from some random website because the reporter in question was too lazy to do their damned job.</p>\n<p>And, according to Corcoran, for me to say otherwise is to engage in &#8220;suppression&#8221; of free speech. It is to engage in an assault on this country&#8217;s cherished freedoms. It is to&#8230; what did he compare it to again? Oh, yes, here&#8217;s what Terence Corcoran of the National Post says it feels like to be subject to a rule that you&#8217;re not allowed to rip off other people&#8217;s work and present it as your own:</p>\n<blockquote><p>something of what it felt like during the Cultural Revolution in China, when ideological enforcers roamed the country to impose their views and expose running-dogs, remove people from their jobs and purge them from the system.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fuck you.</p>\n<p>If this is honestly the best you can come up, then the only meaningful contribution you have left to make to the discussion would be a carefully written letter of resignation. Preferably one that you didn&#8217;t plagiarize from a career advice website.</p>\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6627\" data-text=\"National Post: Plagiarism is Okay Because Free Press is Accountable to No One\" data-count=\"horizontal\">Tweet</a>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Posted','40','Opinion','Opinion',NULL),(338,0,0,'BC Media Tycoon Puts His Best Efforts into Promoting Enbridge Pipeline','text/html','http://sixthestate.net/?p=6621','Media;Canada',NULL,NULL,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,14,'As you may have read a month or so ago, the wealthy owner of a B.C.-based chain of community newspapers &#8212; the sort of papers I assume Enbridge has been devoting a goodly portion of its propaganda budget to &#8212; has emerged as an outspoken supporter of the pipeline.

But not just the pipeline! David Black thinks that if we build a <a href=\"http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Arizona+project+inspires+David+Black/7119135/story.html\">$13 billion refinery in Kitimat</a>, the people of B.C. will support the Northern Gateway pipeline. You see, our environmental concerns will be easily laid aside if we&#8217;re promised a cut of the profits (in the form of jobs). Black also claims that refined fuel products would be less devastating than Albertan bitumen in the event of an ocean spill, which I suppose is true.</p>\n<p>Speaking as someone who was born in British Columbia, I can&#8217;t say enough about the way Black has gone about building support for this project. For instance, so far, he&#8217;s <a href=\"http://kitimatclean.ca/\">created a website</a> for the new refinery which, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll agree, has just about all the bells and whistles you&#8217;d want to put on a website if you were trying to attract billionaire investors to your highly speculative project. I&#8217;ve certainly seen WordPress-based websites with <em>less </em>professionalism, I can tell you that. (Sixth Estate, for instance, is also powered by the free WordPress platform, but his is much, MUCH fancier than mine.)</p>\n<p>Anyhow, the announcement and the company were announced a month ago, but this week Black upped the ante yet again by releasing an opinion poll purporting to show massive support for the new venture. And once again, I have to hand it to him for pulling out all the stops. I&#8217;ve rarely seen an opinion poll, at least one that gets widespread coverage in the Canadian media, done according to a methodology as rigorous, impressive, and all-encompassing as <a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/2012/09/26/publisher-david-black-ups-ante-for-refinery-to-process-northern-gateway-oil/\">this one was</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mr. Black said the poll was conducted by his own company, Black Press Group Ltd.</p>\n<p>The newspaper publisher asked each of its 60 B.C. newspapers to survey 20 random households and placed another 200 calls in locations where it doesn&apos;t own a newspaper. The poll was conducted between Sept. 10 and Sept. 20.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gee. I can&#8217;t imagine what could possibly be wrong with such a poll.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the Black Press website (by my count) lists no less than <a href=\"http://www.blackpress.ca/\">96 publications across British Columbia</a>. I&#8217;m not exactly sure how to explain this discrepancy, but no doubt Black has the job well in hand.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m equally sure that British Columbians will not be troubled by the fact that the owner of a considerable proportion of the province&#8217;s non-Postmedia print media is so heavily involved in a controversial energy project.</p>\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6621\" data-text=\"BC Media Tycoon Puts His Best Efforts into Promoting Enbridge Pipeline\" data-count=\"horizontal\">Tweet</a>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Posted','41','Opinion','Opinion',NULL),(339,0,0,'On September 13th it was High Tea','text/html','http://www.carp.ca/2012/09/29/on-september-13th-it-was-high-tea/','Etobicoke;A Cup of Tea;CARP;seniors;Canada',NULL,NULL,5,NULL,NULL,NULL,8,'The Etobicoke Chapter held its first Afternoon Tea Event on Thursday, September 13th.Â  Â Our gracious host was Scarlett Heights Retirement Residence, who served up a feast of food along with gallons of tea and coffee to wash it all down.Â  They even offered the traditional &apos;afternoon tea&apos; staple â€“ cucumber sandwiches.

The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) defines culture in very broad terms â€“ encompassing many art forms, cultural expressions, and institutions. What is of note is that increasingly the government has associated creative industries, including fashion, advertising, and software development with cultural sectors like arts, museums, and heritage. In <a href=\"http://www.culturalpolicies.net/web/unitedkingdom.php?language=fr\"><em>Cultural Policies and Trends in Europe country profile on the UK</em></a><em>, </em>author Rob Fisher claims this amalgamation of industries and sectors is tied the government&apos;s perspective that the common denominator is economic potential.</p>\n<p>Prioritizing the economic benefits of the cultural sector has been a subtle pillar establishing itself in stone over the past decade. Notably, in 2008, an inter-governmental report was published on the creative industries titled: <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/CEPFeb2008.pdf\"><em>Creative Britain: New Talents for the New Economy</em></a>.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a> Furthermore, in 2010, Dr Dave O&apos;Brien published <a href=\"http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/measuring-the-value-culture-report.pdf\"><em>Measuring the value of culture</em>,</a> commissioned by DCMS. The report calls for increased collaboration between cultural policy makers and economists studying culture. Oriented towards generating a larger market share for culture, the report developed the concept of using datasets and economic indicators for a more robust analysis of culture. (Fisher p.21)</p>\n<p>A component of the current government&apos;s policy platform is to reform the relationship between central (national) government and local communities. The intention is to create more streamlined functions and community-focused initiatives. Understandably, many of the targets are regionally specific. For example, the Local Government White Paper: <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/strongprosperous\"><em>Strong and Prosperous Communities</em></a>, published in 2006, established a framework where priorities for national departments, were locally based. The result of these policies is a reduction in budget and staffing at a national level, in favour of delegating the jurisdiction of culture to local delivery partners (Fisher, p13). The other consequence is a diverse and fragmented cultural policy framework, led by local initiatives rather than a cohesive national cultural policy platform.</p>\n<h3>The Department for Culture, Media and Sport</h3>\n<p>In the UK, the portfolio comparable to the Department of Canadian Heritage, containing the cultural industries, creative sector and the arts, is the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (and recently: Olympics). When developing its strategic objectives for 2008â€“2011, DCMS identified four targets. Out of the four, one focuses on economic imperatives, and the other solely references the Olympics (Fisher, p8).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Opportunity: Encourage more widespread enjoyment of culture, media and sport;</li>\n<li>Excellence: Support talent and excellence in culture, media and sport;</li>\n<li>Economic impact: Realise the economic benefits of the Department&apos;s sectors; and</li>\n<li>Olympics: Deliver a successful and inspirational Olympic and Paralympic Games with a sustainable legacy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Over 95% of DCMS&apos; budget is allocated to the bodies that deliver the department&apos;s aims and objectives. This includes Arts Council England, English Heritage, Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA), and Sport England (Fisher, p8).</p>\n<p><strong>Full article coming soon for members only!</strong></p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>JessicaÂ Litwin is a cultural policy expert, art historian, and communications specialist.

We are systematically examining our model of governance to ensure the sector feels a sense of belonging and participation in the decisions we make as was recommended in the Five Year Strategic Plan adopted by the board last March.</p>\n<p>When we learned the federal government would not be giving us the transitional funding we expected we initially placed an examination of our management style on the second rung of tasks for the CCA. We had to ensure there would be an organization to manage before we could examine the way it was going to be managed in the future! That is the reason why, over the course of the past six months, we concentrated all our efforts on building our membership and developing projects that would appeal to potential investors. And it appears we are headed in the right direction: renewals have been strong, the direction of key projects is becoming clearer and, in their initial phases, projects have been attracting interest. All of this to say, as long as the momentum continues, there will certainly be an organization to manage. The moment has come to highlight how the CCA of tomorrow will be different from the CCA of the past and it starts with the review of our governance model.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the upcoming weeks we will systematically examine the organization. We will review our rules, the size of our board of governors, its make up, and selection process. We need to implement the mandate and organize the four strategic committees recommended by the Strategic Plan. Each committee will be comprised of one member of the board and four to six CCA members with authority over the activities and projects. The committees will work to ensure the CCA&apos;s work reflects the four strategic axes identified in last winter&apos;s meeting; Leadership and Networking, Knowledge Sharing, Government Relations and Public Engagement. The projects and activities that fall under more then one of these axes will be examined by more then one committee to ensure cohesion and the financial viability of the over all project. Finally, we need to assure the organization conforms to the regulations outlined in the new <em>Canada Not-For-Profit Corporations Act</em>. The bottom line is: we need to have everything in place before the general meeting in late June 2013 (but there is little doubt a special assembly will need to be called prior to the previously mentioned date to deal with urgent issues).</p>\n<p>The new changes for membership incorporation will not end on the formal level. We are developing new forms for feed back on specific issues, putting in place committee directors for research projects, advocacy, etc. And on top of all this, there will be a series of initiatives to increase and diversify the composition of our membership.</p>\n<p>In summary, there are a lot of balls in the air, especially when we consider the work that needs to be done to develop our projects and maintain our regular activities. We need to constantly scrutinize our priorities and use of resources. I can tell you that the secretariat is fortunate enough to have a loyal and devoted team but we can&apos;t push our members to the point of burning out!</p>\n<p>And with that been said, I must return to the task at hand!</p>\n<p>â€“Alain</p>\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'News','News',NULL),(351,0,0,'Arts, Games and Change','text/html','http://ccarts.ca/uncategorized/arts-games-and-change/','Uncategorized;Entertainment',NULL,NULL,6,NULL,NULL,NULL,9,'<h5>Arts, Games and Change</h5>\n<p>Our first fall Magazine edition enters the season gracefully.</p>\n<p>Is it really purely by coincidence that we have two articles making reference to the Massey-LÃ©vesque Report in this month&apos;s edition of the Magazine?

We want to enable conversations across the country and help readers learn about communities from all over Canada.</p>\n<p>While watching the vast array of cultural performances at the London Olympic Games this summer, I had to ask myself what if anything will be the legacy of all that? I asked Jessica Litwin, who worked for the CCA for three years, if she could be our observerÂ  in London during the 2012 Games and explain the impact of the Olympics on culture across the pond. However, those who know Jessica Litwin know she could never be limited to only speaking about the Olympic Games. To my great excitement, Jessica has gone above and beyond what was asked of her. She has given us insight on the <a href=\"http://ccarts.ca/in-the-news/an-overview-of-cultural-policy-in-the-uk-a-tale-of-coalition-cuts-creative-industries-cultural-olympiad\" target=\"_blank\">cultural policies feeding the Olympic Games.</a> She also describes how the Games fit into the cultural strategies of the United Kingdom. The first part of the article is available to everyone, but the article in its entirety, is only available to members and will be available in the upcoming days.</p>\n<p>Our next edition will be completely dedicated the CBC and the license renewal hearings at the CRTC that will start on 19th of November. Like it or not, the CBC has impacted the lives of all Canadians. If you would like to be a part of the discussion, send us an article or share your opinion on the subject on our website.</p>\n<p>Finally, my inner hockey fan is a little devastated by the NHL lockout. But others, such as Denis Bertrand, see it as an opportunity for arts presenters. Why not install air hockey tables in the entrance of theatres? It would be a wonderful opportunity to recruit new audiences!</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Happy reading!</p>\n<p>Anne-Marie</p>\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'News','News',NULL),(353,0,0,'Canada must refuel for cultural creativity','text/html','http://ccarts.ca/in-the-news/canada-must-refuel-for-cultural-creativity/','Articles;In the news;Entertainment',NULL,NULL,6,NULL,NULL,NULL,9,'A new strategy is needed to connect creative talent with business and technology From the op-ed page of The Globe and Mail/September 4, 2012-Page A17 Culture is lost at Canada&apos;s economic crossroads.

The issue is critical and urgent. The Conference Board of Canada, measuring innovation in 17 peer countries, has ranked Canada as a woeful 14<sup>th</sup>.</p>\n<p>Last October, \"Innovation Canada: A Call to Action\", an influential report,Â  prepared under the Chairmanship of OPEN TEXT&apos;s Tom Jenkins, emphasised the centrality of innovation as \"the ultimate source of the long-term competitiveness of businesses and the quality of life of Canadians\".</p>\n<p>The mobile digital technology explosion has already transformed many aspects ofÂ  our daily lives. It has dramatically changed our workplaces. Old business models and habits are being challenged, new forms of expression are emerging and our children, the digital natives, are functioning in new ways.</p>\n<p>It has radically altered how we communicate with family and friends, and how we relate to our cultural assets: how we listen to music, how we create and read books; how we distribute and view films; how we use libraries and find information; even how we experience theatre, opera and ballet.</p>\n<p>In order to surf this digital tsunami, we need to understand the broad role of the creative sector in the innovation agenda, and consider how we manage the changes, challenges, and opportunities that will be beneficial to our lives as Canadians.</p>\n<p>Throughout history, creative communities and organizations have been in the forefront of envisioning what might be, venturing beyond traditional boxes, and testing boundaries. They are key elements in any measurement of the quality of life. They nourish and inspire innovation.</p>\n<p>Canada needs a new innovative economic \"Road Map\" firmly linking dynamic creative and cultural sectors with open and welcoming business and technologyÂ  sectors. This collaboration is essential to our achieving the Canada we want to be.</p>\n<p>Our innovative arts, culture and heritage sector already generates over $46 billion for the Canadian economy and employs over 600,000 people. These figures alone suggest that governments and the business community should recognize the potential of this sector to be mobilized and to play an evolving role in pointing the way to a successful innovation strategy.</p>\n<p>Canadians should be made more aware that there is a much broader creativeÂ  constituency than just those in the traditional visual and performing arts. Creativity is nurtured within many professional sectors:Â  architects, graphic artists, fashion and industrial designers, video games creators, journalists, broadcasters, research scientists of all kinds, health care professionals, academics, teachers â€“ and many others â€“ particularly among those involved in our dynamic digital technology sector.</p>\n<p>One can only begin to imagine the incredible economic benefits for Canada from a \"coalition of creators\", encouraging the nimble minds from the vital cultural sector to collaborate with other creative design sectors, and the burgeoning digital technology sector. Together, they could provide innovative fuel for all of our new media platforms and become effective drivers for fresh sustainable growth.</p>\n<p>With new connectivity tools already embedded in nearly every home, business and institution, the essential infrastructure is already in place for governments to launch a comprehensive national, culturally inclusive, digital innovation strategy.</p>\n<p>In doing so, this fresh economic paradigm will undoubtedly lead to a renewed focus on shared values and subsequently to the creation of a new, vibrant and inspired cultural \"Road Map\".Â  An updated Massey Report would build on the close interdependence of innovation, economic policy, arts, culture and the broad creative sector to establish a resilient framework for a more dynamic society.</p>\n<p>Time is critical and opportunities fleeting.

They previously depended on traditional media outlets to promote themselves. The methods of communication were \"simpler\"; it was sufficient to give a statement, broadcast a commercial, print advisements and posters and that was that. Social media is a more demanding form of communication. It requires frequent updates to bring in results. This is why I recommend, to all my clients, using a short evaluation to assess their communications; are they working effectively? Is the method being used simply out of habit, all the while knowing there is a better method?Â  Why not invest some time into the production of social media content? This should be self evident in the arts and culture sector because one of the main goals is to tell stories. So, use social media as a tool to announce your next activity and speak more frequently to your audience, offer them virtual tours of your work, mention your successes, expose them to your work between showings, present profiles of employees, board members, volunteers and artists, speak to the ways your product has affected people&apos;s lives and so on. You can even promote community events organized by other groups. Your &apos;friends&apos; and &apos;subscribers&apos; will not hesitate to share their positive experiences and reciprocate your generosity.</p>\n<p>It&apos;s true that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arts and culture consumers are ageing. It&apos;s the case with <a href=\"http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/100526/dq100526b-eng.htm\">Canadian society</a> in general.</li>\n<li>Our communities welcome people from different backgrounds who have integrated into Canadian society. Our cultures are different but often have many similarities.</li>\n<li>Certain segments of the population consume arts and culture in different manners (online or at home with new technologies) others prefer to invent in the creation of culture rather than simply be consumers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The challenge exists for all sizes of artistic organizations who want to rejuvenate, diversify and increase their audiences. The use or traditional media, and even social media, is not sufficient to reach the desired number of audience members. To do this we need to invest in the development of direct relationships with desired clients. Whether, it is adolescents, young adults, members of the cultural community, or people with disposable income who can buy your products.</p>\n<p>The effort, I am about to describe cannot be achieved by a single person. It needs to be adopted by all members of your team, the board, your volunteers and your most fiercely loyal clients. In summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leave the office and meet the people whom you want to attract. You can contact individuals or groups. Speak to them about what you do and how you serve the community. Avoid over the top promotional tactics and really listen to what the public has to say.Â  Share what you discovered with your colleagues and work together to formulate conclusions from the work.</li>\n<li>Call on the members of your board and your network to introduce you to people who will exert influence over your target audience.</li>\n<li>Familiarize yourself with the culture of your audience. It&apos;s a good practice; after all, you want them to accept your own!</li>\n<li>Fully immerse yourself in this exercise. Be prepared to revisit your function and your offer. And, above all, have patience. Do not forget, long term relationships do not occur over night.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I already know what your objection to this approach is: We don&apos;t have the time to do all of this! Rather than going after the public at large, target one group and invest your organization&apos;s time into reaching them. Start a pilot project over a year or two. Document your progression using social media. You can enlist allies.</p>\n<p>I have often said, it&apos;s not necessary to spend great amounts of money to understand the ways to develop your audience. You only need to invest time and will power.</p>\n<p>Don&apos;t hesitate to let us know your solutions for reaching larger audiences!</p>\n<p><em>Denis J.

However, he would be the first to tell you that none of it would have been possible without the collaboration of others. Not only that, he insists that he has gotten more out of his professional experiences than he has put into them. \"The transformative change that arises from art can happen to us everyday.\"</p>\n<p>Collaboration and, to some extent, transformation wove their way through our conversation with Jeff Melanson last week. Whether the topic was his own adaptation to life at Banff, creating a globally competitive creative culture for Canada, forming a Federal Culture Action Plan, advice for the CCA&apos;s renewal, or extra-curricular pursuits, somehow the common thread was collaboration and transformation.</p>\n<p>Personally, Melanson has embraced the challenge of immersing himself in the local culture. He skied downhill for the first time at the beginning of the year, is acquainting himself with local indigenous arts leaders and is trying to \"walk the walk\". In other words, he believes it is important for an arts director to be involved in the creative process.</p>\n<h3>CANADA â€“ A GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE CULTURE?</h3>\n<p>Melanson believes that Canada can create a \"globally competitive creative culture with the incredible range and diversity of artistic talent in this country.\" This can be fostered by what he sees as a robust economic engine behind arts and culture, multi-generational Canadian families supporting the arts and a rich multi-cultural society. He states that there is a pretty interesting mix of government and private sector support. The private sector has stepped up over the years and as public sector arts funding is cut, public private-partnerships become that much more important.</p>\n<p>Potential limitations to fostering Canada&apos;s globally competitive creative culture stem from the great distances between Canada&apos;s major cultural centres that contribute to a regional or silo thinking and keeps the arts and culture sector from acting as a group. Further, Melanson adds that the Massey-LÃ©vesque Commission&apos;s report (1951) outlining the national cultural policies is old and needs to be updated.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>A NATIONAL CULTURAL ACTION PLAN FOR CANADA?</h3>\n<p>Before assuming responsibilities at the Banff Centre at the beginning of this year, Melanson participated in the development of Creative Capital Gains, the cultural action plan endorsed by Toronto&apos;s City Council. When asked if he can imagine a Federal Cultural Action Plan, Melanson speculates that this might come to pass. The arts and culture sector is ready to look at more collaboration and provincial barriers are breaking down.Â  He adds that it would be nice if the Minister of Heritage would convene a summit for the arts, much in the same way that other ministers host summits for industries in their portfolios. And while facilitation of a national cultural action plan could come from outside the government (remember, a businessman and an academic led the Massey-LÃ©vesque Commission), the government needs to be at the table.</p>\n<a href=\"http://ccarts.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Laura-Vanags-The-Banff-Centre2.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-12214 \" title=\"Laura Vanags-The Banff Centre2\" src=\"http://ccarts.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Laura-Vanags-The-Banff-Centre2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"210\" height=\"119\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by: Laura Vanags-The Banff Centre</p> 					A globally respected arts, cultural, and educational institution and conference facility, the Banff Centre is a leader in the development and promotion of creative work in the arts, sciences, business and the environment.</p>\n<p>The CCA is happy to count this prestigious Canadian Institution amongst its members.Â \n				 					<a href=\"http://ccarts.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Laura-Vanags-The-Banff-Centre-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-12207 \" title=\"Laura Vanags-The Banff Centre 1\" src=\"http://ccarts.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Laura-Vanags-The-Banff-Centre-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"288\" height=\"192\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by: Laura Vanags-The Banff Centre</p>\n<p>No one single organization in the country can put forward a national cultural action plan. For such a plan to be realized, Melanson says, the arts and culture sector would have to collaborate. The sector needs to be less competitive and more impassioned for the overall goal. Collaboration within the sector makes even more sense in tough economic times, in terms of making the most of the available resources.</p>\n<p>Asked about the role of an organization like the CCA in the current environment, Melanson says that there is a need for an organization to have a sector-wide or balanced view. The arts, culture and heritage sector cannot afford to be partisan or overly oriented to one part of the whole.</p>\n<h3>ADVICE FOR RENEWAL</h3>\n<p>Melanson is no stranger to the renewal process. He has directly participated in the transformation of institutions such as the Royal Conservatory of Music and the National Ballet School, and is now at the helm of the Banff Centre as it enters the second phase of its revitalization program. Given his credentials in the area, the CCA did not hesitate to ask for advice to inspire its own renewal.Â  Melanson&apos;s response, generalized to the whole arts sector: Have a Big Vision; be relentless; be open-minded to ideas; and, compromise only when appropriate.</p>\n<p>Jeff Melanson has been president of The Banff Centre for nearly nine months and reports on all sides are glowing. We at the CCA look forward to seeing progress at the centre under Melanson&apos;s direction as it moves forward, embracing digital media and pushing creative boundaries into the 21st century.</p> 					<h3>Brief Biography</h3>\n<p>Jeff Melanson was appointed president of The Banff Centre on January 1, 2012. Jeff Melanson holds a bachelor of music from the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, where he studied opera, Russian art song, and choral conducting. Melanson also pursued vocal studies at the Oberlin Conservatory. He holds an MBA from Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo.</p>\n<p>From 1998 to 2000, Melanson was the director of development for Opera Ontario. In March 2000, he was appointed assistant dean of the Community School at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, and at the end of 2001, he was promoted to dean. In his role as dean of RCM&apos;s Community School, Melanson was essential in building the program into the largest community arts school in North America.</p>\n<p>In 2006, Melanson was appointed executive director and co-chief executive officer of Canada&apos;s National Ballet School. In his time at NBS, he was instrumental in eliminating a significant annual operating deficit, increasing annual revenues by over 50 per cent, overseeing the completion of NBS&apos;s residence renovations, and creating new strategic partnerships with many non-profit and for-profit arts and entertainment corporations.</p>\n<p>Melanson is a member of the Young Presidents&apos; Organization and a trustee with the National Guild for Community Arts Education (US). He is a frequent guest lecturer on arts management to arts students and MBA classes from universities across North America and around the world, and was the first arts leader to be appointed one of Canada&apos;s Top 40 Under 40â„¢ for 2009. In 2010, Melanson was named Wilfrid Laurier University&apos;s MBA Alumnus of the Year. In November 2010, Melanson was appointed special advisor on arts and culture to Toronto mayor Rob Ford.\n				\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'News','News',NULL),(356,0,0,'CCA Budget Analyses','text/html','http://ccarts.ca/resources/federal-policies-investments/cca-budget-analyses/','Economic Analyses;Federal Policies & Investments;Entertainment',NULL,NULL,6,NULL,NULL,NULL,9,'The CCA&apos;s 2011, 2010, and 2009 budget analyses are available free for our members and at the cost of 25$ for non-members.

Readers may recall that last year, to highlight the consistency of its approach, the government reintroduced its electoral budget. Whereas in our analysis of that budget, we wondered where the axe would fall, this year we can detect certain lines of positioning. However, the lack of transparency in the communication of measures taken by the government and the multiplicity of decision-centres involved made this year&apos;s analysis more difficult. And as the cuts are spread over three years, it is still unclear how institutions will implement them.</p>\n<p>In general, the cultural sector as a whole fared a lot better than many feared, although some areas have been seriously hit. According to the expense plan, the level of funding from the Department of Canadian Heritage and its agencies declined by nearly $200 million (6.1%). All organizations experienced a decrease in their funding with the exception of the Canadian Museum of Nature. The Canada Council for the Arts took a hit of only 0.1%, but remember, that these agencies, like the Department, must absorb the cost of inflation on goods and services and on salaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Â </strong></p>\n<h2>What are the positions arising from the budget?</h2>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>The government has yet to present a clear or complete vision of its cultural policy. However, a general position emerges from choices made over the past few years:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An accent on private public partnerships;</li>\n<li>Financial support is not an entitlement. Several organizations have learned that this year, including the CCA;</li>\n<li>The government is concentrating its efforts on what it considers to be the \"fundamental roles\" of the federal government;</li>\n<li>The government appears to consider culture as purely a domestic affair and is lessening its support of international cultural activities; and,</li>\n<li>The government imparts a more military and political angle than a cultural one to the notion of heritage (e.g., War of 1812, Royal Jubilee, Franklin Expedition).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>Who Loses Out?</h2>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Our analysis confirms a fact which rapidly appeared obvious: the audiovisual sector suffered the most from the budget cuts, followed by the heritage sector, despite the protections granted to the national museums.</p>\n<p>In the audiovisual sector, we were well prepared for the cuts to the CBC, so the only surprise is the collateral damage produced. The cuts of $115 million dollars are not trivial. To that, we must add the CRTC&apos;s elimination of the Local Programming Improvement Fund (LPIF), used by 20 English and French television stations in the CBC-Radio-Canada networks to produce regional programs. This amounts to a $40 million loss that particularly hurts francophone communities who had benefited from a greater number of regional newscasts. The NFB and Telefilm Canada also had to endure 10% cuts in their budgets.</p>\n<p>With respect to heritage, the government spared the national museums and increased the indemnification limit in the Canada Travelling Exhibitions Indemnification Program. Nonetheless, Minister Flaherty&apos;s budget was quite harsh for the heritage sector.</p>\n<p>The impact of the cuts made by the Department of Canadian Heritage at the Library and Archives Canada will be disastrous: the cancellation of the National Archival Development Program (NADP) affects numerous provincial archive councils and will lead to the closure of several archive centers. To the severe cuts at Heritage, we must add the just as stringent cuts imposed on Parks Canada. We will recall that, some years ago, Parks Canada was transferred to Environment Canada and seems to suffer from its estrangement with Canadian Heritage.</p>\n<p>Severe cuts at Statistics Canada have led to the demise of the last remnants of a once vibrant Culture Statistics Division and the budget also drove the final nail into the coffin of cultural diplomacy. Cultural attachÃ©s, international academic relations and Canadian studies abroad all fell under the axe.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>Tell me more</h2>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Close to 25 pages of analysis and tables are available in our <a href=\"http://ccarts.ca/in-the-news/press-releases/ccas-federal-budget-analysis-to-be-released-september-18-2012/\">analysis of the federal budget</a>.

Everyone feels a little nervous. The CCA is no exception; we have some jitters seeing everything that is happening around us.</p>\n<h2>The Reopening of Parliament</h2>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Next Monday, the 17th is the reopening of parliament. What should we expect? Short of any unexpected surprises, not much directly relating to culture is on the government&apos;s agenda since C-11 was passed before the summer recess in June. Therefore we turn our gaze towards the Finance Committee once again.</p>\n<h2>The Pre-budget Submissions</h2>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Like every year, the Finance Committee of the House of Commons invited all Canadians to share their priorities for the 2013 Federal Budget. The CCA made itsÂ <a href=\"http://ccarts.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/CCA-2012-prebudget-submission-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">submission</a> and recommendations this summer and hopes to have the opportunity to appear before the committee.</p>\n<p>Numerous CCA members also contributed to the annual ritual. We present you with an overview of the recommendations made by the cultural sector. The CCA consulted with many of its members to prepare its submission, and noticed agreement in many of the submissions to the committee. We obtained the submissions from <a href=\"http://www.actra.ca/main/bulletins/2012/07/federal-budget-2013-have-your-say/\" target=\"_blank\">ACTRA</a> , The Canadian Museum Association (CMA), the Canadian Arts Presenters Association (<a href=\"http://www.capacoa.ca/en/services/arts-promotion/news/341-prebudget-brief-2012\">CAPACOA</a>), the <a href=\"http://www.writersunion.ca/news/twucs-2013-prebudget-submission\">Writers Union of Canada (TWUC)</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.canadianartscoalition.com/2012/08/07/brief-to-the-standing-committee-on-finance-3/\">Canadian Arts Coalition</a>, the Association des producteurs de film et de tÃ©lÃ©vision du QuÃ©bec (<a href=\"http://apftq.qc.ca/upload/fr/memoire/APFTQ%20-%20consultations%20pr%C3%A9budg%C3%A9taires%20f%C3%A9d%C3%A9rales%202012%20(version%20d%C3%A9pos%C3%A9e%20le%203%20ao%C3%BBt%2012).pdf\">APFTQ</a>), the <a href=\"http://publishers.ca/images/downloads/2012-acp-prebudget.pdf\">Association of Canadian Publishers (ACP)</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.imaa.ca/tiny_mce/plugins/uploaded/2012%20Pre%20Budget%20Submission.pdf\">Independent Media Arts Alliance (IMAA)</a>, the <a href=\"http://canadiancraftsfederation.typepad.com/canadian-crafts-federatn/2012/08/priorities-for-the-2013-federal-budget.html\">Canadian Craft Federation</a> CCF, and from the <a href=\"http://www.mal.ca/editor_files/publications/110/MAL_Consultations-prebudgetaires_3aout-2012.pdf\">Mouvement des arts et des lettres Â du QuÃ©bec (MAL)</a>.<strong></strong></p>\n<p>It&apos;s not surprising to find recommendations on training in the cultural sector, fiscal measures, funding for Canadian content, and maintaining data and statistics in the cultural sector in many of the submissions. Certainly maintaining and increasing the funding of the arts, culture and heritage such as the Canada Council for the Arts, as well as institutions responsible for audiovisuals such as Telefilm, CBC and the NFB.</p>\n<p>In fact, if the milieu was relieved to find out in MarchÂ that the Canada Council&apos;s budget was maintained, it reacted weeks later asking that the cuts to the Heritage Department&apos;s programs, Parks Canada, and the Library and Archives be re-examined. Â Mouvement des arts et des lettres (MAL) notably invited the Canadian government to, \"reconsider the $191 million cuts announced in the Finance Minister&apos;s 2012â€“2013 budget.\" The Writer&apos;s Union of Canada recommended reinvesting in Library and Archives, \"both on a permanent basis and with additional funding from the budget for the 150th celebrations â€“ for the preservation, access and digitization of our heritage.\"</p>\n<p>Training was also a theme present in many of the submissions, notably intergenerational mentoring. The recommendations in this area kept returning to one point in regards to the cuts to the Cultural Human Resources Council (CHRC).</p>\n<p>The Association of Canadian Publisher&apos;s (ACP) recommended establishing measures to promote advanced reading skills. The ACP said, \"Advanced reading skills, with access to appropriate reading material, improves employment prospects, strengthens communities, and helps new Canadians adapt to new workplace environments and new cultural values.\" The association also supports strengthening the Canadian ownership rules in the book sector.</p>\n<p>One of the questions addressed byÂ the committee was the aging population. Certain organizations proposed fiscal measures to encourage cultural workers to prolong their working lives beyond 65 (MAL). ACTRA recommended that the government invest in services such as the Performing Arts Lodges of Canada, or in the assistance network for senior artists in Canada, \"that directly address the unique needs of some of our most vulnerable citizens, senior artists.\"</p>\n<p>Lastly, the subject of copyright was also raised. Many, including ACTRA, the CCA and TWUC demanded that a part of the revenues coming from copyright be exempted from taxation as it already is in Quebec. The MAL was a bit harsher and pressed for the government to take responsibility for decisions taken within the framework of the new copyright law that will deprive artists of $126 million.</p>\n<p>Evidently, many organizations also made particular recommendations for their sectors. Notably:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CAPACOA</strong> recommended that the government invest in touring and distribution here and abroad and adopt mechanisms to support co-productions to maintain and stimulate increased exportation of cultural goods and services.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>TWUC</strong> recommended a tax exemption for subsistence grants administered by the Canada Council which provide minimal stipends for artists for several months while they focus on their cultural work.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>CMA</strong> recommended a $5 million increase to the Young Canada Works program in museums. This would generate close to a thousand new jobs for students and graduates in the cultural sector.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Canadian Arts Coalition</strong> requested that the government \"invest, as circumstances permit, in the infrastructure (both human and financial) directed to supporting arts and culture within Canada&apos;s network of embassies and consulates.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ACTRA</strong> requested the government re-establish income tax averaging for artists.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>APFTQ</strong> requested the allocation of funds to finance CanadianÂ digital cultural content.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Canadian Craft Federation</strong> requested that the government ensure that counterpart funds to <a href=\"http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/workplaceskills/trades_apprenticeship/red_seal/index.shtml\">Red Seal trades</a> are available to craft artists and that craft apprenticeships be developed.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Independent Media Arts Alliance</strong> (IMAA) asserts in its brief that increased investment in the Canada Council will allow artist-run organizations to purchase modern equipment and offer affordable workshops for Canadians.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don&apos;t forget that the CCA&apos;s <a href=\"http://ccarts.ca/front-page-slider/ccas-federal-budget-analysis-to-be-released-september-18-2012/\">Federal Budget Analysis</a> from the cultural perspective will be out September 18th!

With September 15 now in the books, the NHL has locked out the National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA), bringing about the second NHL work stoppage of the past decade.</p> <hr /> <p><a href=\"http://theomega.ca/2012/09/17/2012-nhl-lockout-two-fans-two-opinions/\"><strong>Click here for the original story from The Omega</strong></a></p> <hr /> <p>One of the more contentious issues currently driving a stake between the NHL and NHLPA is the division of hockey-related revenues (HRR). Coming out of the 2011-12 NHL season, the league raked in $3.3 billion in HRR.</p> <p>Under the now-expired collective bargaining agreement (CBA), the players were entitled to and received fifty-seven per cent of that revenue in the form of salaries and performance bonuses.</p> <p>The initial CBA proposal that came from the NHL head office called for the NHLPA to take a cut in their share of the revenue, from fifty-seven per cent under the old CBA to forty-three per cent within the confines of the new proposal.</p> <p>While there are countless other issues complicating the CBA negotiations between the two sides, this is the one that sticks out like a sore thumb and has fans all over the world crying out in anger. I am one of those fans.</p> <p>The game of hockey has seen unprecedented growth since it returned from the previous lockout in 2005. Under the previous CBA, it has become extremely apparent that there is a wealth of problems resulting in large-market teams more-or-less bullying small-market teams out of the competition for high-end talent in the free agency market simply because the large-market teams have a bigger payroll.</p> <p>This angers me.</p> <p>Yes, it is business and often times the fatter cheque book or more creative marketer will win the game. But we consistently see Gary Bettman, commissioner of the NHL, platforming on TV about how the owners are looking out for the best interests of the game.</p> <p>My question is, how are they looking out for the best interests of the game when they cannot even follow the rules they themselves put in place during previous CBA negotiations?</p> <p>What we have is a group of billionaire business owners looking to maximize profit. Can they be blamed for that? No. But they can be blamed for being so bull-headed that they refuse to compromise on their side of the negotiations.</p> <p>It&apos;s an unfortunate circumstance and a sad, sad situation for hockey fans all over the country. I hate to say it, but I don&apos;t expect to have NHL hockey back on my calendar until January 2013.</p> <p>In the meantime, I plan on fulfilling my thirst for Canada&apos;s game by checking out my local Canadian Major Junior club, my campus&apos; varsity hockey team and the local junior B squad that doesn&apos;t get as much attention as it deserves. I hope that all of you passionate hockey fans do the same. And don&apos;t necessarily go crawling back to the NHL as soon as it returns. How else will the greedy, selfish owners of that business learn a lesson if the people who provide the revenue come back at the drop of a hat?</p> <p>Adam Williams, Sports Editor</p> <p>The fact that we sit in this situation again, a mere seven years later is appalling. With the NHL&apos;s collective bargaining agreement having expired on Sept. 15, it&apos;s become pretty unlikely that we will be seeing any NHL hockey in the next few months, as for the second time in a decade the NHLPA and the NHL have been unable to settle their labour dispute.</p> <p>While I&apos;d like to think things will be resolved soon and we can all get back to watching Canada&apos;s national sport (OK, so not officially, but you know what I mean), with what I know of the dispute and the people involved, I&apos;ll go on the record as a pessimist.</p> <p>My prediction? The season won&apos;t start until after American Thanksgiving.</p> <p>The sad thing is, that prediction is on the optimistic end of the scale. Most see this dispute spilling over into 2013 and the extremists expect we&apos;ll miss another complete season. I can&apos;t personally see things going that far and there&apos;s a few reasons why:</p> <p>The NHL landed a gigantic 10-year, $2-billion ($200-million annually) television contract with the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) last year and majority of the league&apos;s coverage will come after Thanksgiving. Sure, NBC will be paying the NHL throughout the lockout, but I can&apos;t see NHL owners, who repeatedly assert that they are trying to \"grow the game\" in America, being willing to forfeit a year of primetime television coverage. After all, the lockout is happening because the owners assert they aren&apos;t making enough money. Missing out on TV coverage would only exacerbate that.</p> <p>The men involved in this dispute are stubborn, but they aren&apos;t dumb. Neither side wants to see this dispute ruin years of diligent PR work and alienate the fan base they have spent so much time cultivating. Unfortunately, as soon as the owners locked the players out some fans threw in the towel on their hockey fandom and who&apos;s to blame them? None of the other three major professional sports leagues have gone through two lockouts in the past decade.</p> <p>The Winter Classic is kind of a big deal. As perfect a PR stunt as it would be for the NHL to open the season in January with the Winter Classic, I don&apos;t know that an outdoor game in the bitter cold of Detroit is the smartest environment â€“ from a player safety standpoint â€“ to start their season in.

With September 15 now in the books, the NHL has locked out the National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA), bringing about the second NHL work stoppage of the past decade.</p> <hr /> <p><a href=\"http://theomega.ca/2012/09/17/2012-nhl-lockout-two-fans-two-opinions/\"><strong>Click here for the original story from The Omega</strong></a></p> <hr /> <p>One of the more contentious issues currently driving a stake between the NHL and NHLPA is the division of hockey-related revenues (HRR). Coming out of the 2011-12 NHL season, the league raked in $3.3 billion in HRR.</p> <p>Under the now-expired collective bargaining agreement (CBA), the players were entitled to and received fifty-seven per cent of that revenue in the form of salaries and performance bonuses.</p> <p>The initial CBA proposal that came from the NHL head office called for the NHLPA to take a cut in their share of the revenue, from fifty-seven per cent under the old CBA to forty-three per cent within the confines of the new proposal.</p> <p>While there are countless other issues complicating the CBA negotiations between the two sides, this is the one that sticks out like a sore thumb and has fans all over the world crying out in anger. I am one of those fans.</p> <p>The game of hockey has seen unprecedented growth since it returned from the previous lockout in 2005. Under the previous CBA, it has become extremely apparent that there is a wealth of problems resulting in large-market teams more-or-less bullying small-market teams out of the competition for high-end talent in the free agency market simply because the large-market teams have a bigger payroll.</p> <p>This angers me.</p> <p>Yes, it is business and often times the fatter cheque book or more creative marketer will win the game. But we consistently see Gary Bettman, commissioner of the NHL, platforming on TV about how the owners are looking out for the best interests of the game.</p> <p>My question is, how are they looking out for the best interests of the game when they cannot even follow the rules they themselves put in place during previous CBA negotiations?</p> <p>What we have is a group of billionaire business owners looking to maximize profit. Can they be blamed for that? No. But they can be blamed for being so bull-headed that they refuse to compromise on their side of the negotiations.</p> <p>It&apos;s an unfortunate circumstance and a sad, sad situation for hockey fans all over the country. I hate to say it, but I don&apos;t expect to have NHL hockey back on my calendar until January 2013.</p> <p>In the meantime, I plan on fulfilling my thirst for Canada&apos;s game by checking out my local Canadian Major Junior club, my campus&apos; varsity hockey team and the local junior B squad that doesn&apos;t get as much attention as it deserves. I hope that all of you passionate hockey fans do the same. And don&apos;t necessarily go crawling back to the NHL as soon as it returns. How else will the greedy, selfish owners of that business learn a lesson if the people who provide the revenue come back at the drop of a hat?</p> <p>Adam Williams, Sports Editor</p> <p>The fact that we sit in this situation again, a mere seven years later is appalling. With the NHL&apos;s collective bargaining agreement having expired on Sept. 15, it&apos;s become pretty unlikely that we will be seeing any NHL hockey in the next few months, as for the second time in a decade the NHLPA and the NHL have been unable to settle their labour dispute.</p> <p>While I&apos;d like to think things will be resolved soon and we can all get back to watching Canada&apos;s national sport (OK, so not officially, but you know what I mean), with what I know of the dispute and the people involved, I&apos;ll go on the record as a pessimist.</p> <p>My prediction? The season won&apos;t start until after American Thanksgiving.</p> <p>The sad thing is, that prediction is on the optimistic end of the scale. Most see this dispute spilling over into 2013 and the extremists expect we&apos;ll miss another complete season. I can&apos;t personally see things going that far and there&apos;s a few reasons why:</p> <p>The NHL landed a gigantic 10-year, $2-billion ($200-million annually) television contract with the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) last year and majority of the league&apos;s coverage will come after Thanksgiving. Sure, NBC will be paying the NHL throughout the lockout, but I can&apos;t see NHL owners, who repeatedly assert that they are trying to \"grow the game\" in America, being willing to forfeit a year of primetime television coverage. After all, the lockout is happening because the owners assert they aren&apos;t making enough money. Missing out on TV coverage would only exacerbate that.</p> <p>The men involved in this dispute are stubborn, but they aren&apos;t dumb. Neither side wants to see this dispute ruin years of diligent PR work and alienate the fan base they have spent so much time cultivating. Unfortunately, as soon as the owners locked the players out some fans threw in the towel on their hockey fandom and who&apos;s to blame them? None of the other three major professional sports leagues have gone through two lockouts in the past decade.</p> <p>The Winter Classic is kind of a big deal. As perfect a PR stunt as it would be for the NHL to open the season in January with the Winter Classic, I don&apos;t know that an outdoor game in the bitter cold of Detroit is the smartest environment â€“ from a player safety standpoint â€“ to start their season in. The earlier this dispute is settled, the earlier the NHL can start promoting the event and ensuring that it&apos;s the biggest Winter Classic yet.</p> <p>So there&apos;s my optimistic assessment of how this lockout is going to proceed. Personally, I&apos;ve been resigned to this happening for about a year now, so I&apos;m not all that surprised or upset, but I&apos;d still like to see the NHL start up before too much time is missed. Until that time I guess I&apos;ll have to be satisfied with watching major junior and collegiate hockey, which, let&apos;s be honest, is still a pretty sweet gig.</p> <p>And hey, at least I don&apos;t have to shell out 200 dollars to go to those games.</p> <p>-30-</p>\n   ',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'News','News',NULL),(659,0,0,'African trip spawns life change for UNB Basketball player ','text/html','http://cupwire.hotink.net/articles/53217','Province',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,12,'\n<p><strong></strong></h2><p>Sports</strong></p><p><strong>Bronte James - The Brunswickan (University of New Brunswick)</strong></p><p>FREDERICTON (CUP) - From the moment the plane landed in Malawi, Africa, Melissa Foster knew her trip with the Active Youth Organization and Right to Play would change her life.</p> <hr /> <p><a href=\"http://thebruns.ca/sports/malawi-spawns-new-perspective/\"><strong>Click here for the original story from the Brunswickan</strong></a></p> <hr /> <p>\"When we first got off the plane, there was this little girl in the window, and it was just so cute because we were high fiving her through the window and playing,\" Foster said.</p> <hr /> <p><a href=\"http://cupwire.ca/articles/52514\"><strong>Click here for a preview of Melissa&apos;s trip posted to the CUP Wire last year</strong></a></p> <hr /> <p>\"It kind of set the tone for the whole trip because this little girl was so excited to see us.\"</p> <p>Foster and others involved in the Active Youth Group paid the toll to cross the man-made bridge, and only bridge into the village, to meet the Chiefs â€“ a tradition when first visiting the village.

It was the latest instalment in a series of international trips that has seen UBC travel to places such as Argentina and Australia over the past several years.</p> <p>\"We don&apos;t have exposure to field hockey [in Canada] on the TV or on the field,... so when we go to some of the other countries,... these players are some of the best in the world,\" said Kanjee. \"So we get exposed to kids the same age as our university kids, but their skill levels are considerably higher because they start at four, five, six, seven years of age.</p> <p>\"We do learn lots when we go to these things, so it&apos;s a really, really good thing.\"</p> <p>The experience will undoubtedly be a huge asset come the Canada West regular season, which consists of eight games. The conference only includes UBC, Calgary and Victoria this year, and the first-place team at the end of the regular season will be named champion.</p> <p>With such a talented squad and a short season, it&apos;s easy to assume that the road to their tenth-straight Canada West championship and nationals won&apos;t pose too much difficulty to the T-Birds. But Kanjee is hesitant to proclaim that success is guaranteed.</p> <p>\"Victoria has been our traditional rival and they&apos;ll be nothing short of that, so they&apos;ll be good again, [and] Calgary has picked up a lot.... If they manage to get them pointed in the right direction, anything is possible.\"</p> <p>UBC will also have to play their first home games at Tamanawis Secondary School in Surrey because their field on campus is under construction.</p> <p>Even if the &apos;Birds coast to nationals with their team that \"goes down quite deep\" in regard to quality players, there is a major hurdle that they must overcome if they want to knock off the other teams from across Canada.</p> <p>\"My one concern is that the tournament is going to be held back in Ontario,... and they don&apos;t have a proper field,\" he said. \"They have a field turf, and when you play on field turf it is a great equalizer. If we were playing on a proper field like we have here at UBC, I&apos;d say our chances would be very, very high. If we go to field turf, it&apos;s more of a flip of a coin.\"</p> <p>It will definitely be an interesting season for UBC, but also a promising one.</p> <p>\"[We have] a very, very good side; I&apos;m expecting everybody to partake in however well the team does,\" said Kanjee.</p> <p>With a stacked roster, a legendary coach and international experience against some of the best teams in the world, the rest of Canada will be looking out for the T-Birds.</p> <p>-30-</p>\n   ',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'News','News',NULL),(661,0,0,'Jan Wong on workplace depression and turning a negative to a positive','text/html','http://cupwire.hotink.net/articles/53177','Province',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,12,'\n<p><strong></strong></h2><p>News</strong></p><p><strong>Chad Betteridge - The Aquinian (St. Thomas University)</strong></p><p>FREDERICTON (CUP) - Those who don&apos;t know Jan Wong might not believe she has been responsible for striking fear into the hearts of many, for nearly two decades.</p> <p>Wong is a small woman, sitting in a dark green velvet chair and sipping a cup of coffee.

The Liberals were down seven points to only 20%, while the Greens were up one to 7%.<br /><br />Now, Ontario has been a very confusing province when it comes to polling. Forum is recording a huge shift in support, which is not implausible considering the difficult headlines for the McGuinty government of late. But the other firm active in Ontario, Nanos Research, has been consistently at odds with what Forum has reported. Will the next poll from Nanos show these sort of stellar NDP gains?<br /><br />The gains and losses for the NDP and Liberals are statistically significant, with the most important shifts in support having taken place in the Greater Toronto Area. There, the Liberals fell 10 points to 20%, with the NDP gaining seven to hit 34%. In the 416 area code, the Liberals were down 15 points to only 22%.<br /><br />Everywhere in Ontario, the Progressive Conservatives and New Democrats were either tied (southwestern Ontario) or held insignificant leads over the other party (the Tories in eastern Ontario, the 905 area code, and northern Ontario, the NDP in the 416 area code). It would make for a very close election result, with the Liberals shunted off to the side.<br /><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_6InBChAcNM/UGWqkABGpTI/AAAAAAAAKiQ/AHVU2ISm8WM/s1600/ON+Seats.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"107\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_6InBChAcNM/UGWqkABGpTI/AAAAAAAAKiQ/AHVU2ISm8WM/s400/ON+Seats.PNG\" width=\"400\" /></a>And dramatically so. With no pocket of regional strength, the Liberals could only hope to hold on to a handful of seats. The projection model gives them only three, all in Toronto. The Progressive Conservatives win a majority government of 64 seats while the New Democrats win 40.<br /><br />That two-point edge is rather decisive for the Tories, as the NDP vote in Ontario is pretty inefficient. But the degree of inefficiency that Forum assigns to them is a little ridiculous. Forum&apos;s seat projection model would award the Tories 60 seats, the NDP 24, and the Liberals 23. With their own regional results showing the Liberals with no regional concentration of support, it makes very little sense that Forum&apos;s model would still give the Liberals that many seats. If the Liberals still had a lot of support in Toronto but had dropped everywhere else, then the sort of result envisioned by Forum could be possible. But with only 22% support in their best region of the province, it just wouldn&apos;t happen.<br /><br />According to Forum, Dalton McGuinty&apos;s personal numbers have collapsed. He used to enjoy better approval ratings than the unloved Tim Hudak, but no more. His approval rating dropped nine points to only 20% and his disapproval increased by seven points to 67%. Even among the dwindling number of Liberal supporters his numbers have dropped by six points to 71% approval.<br /><br />That is not to say that Hudak has taken advantage of this. His numbers have held relatively steady, with an approval rating of 26% and a disapproval rating of 49%. The biggest shift came among PC voters - his approval rating was down five points to only 48% among his party&apos;s supporters.<br /><br />Andrea Horwath&apos;s numbers were also rather static, with her approval rating registering 48% and her disapproval rating dropping four points to 23%. Both Hudak and Horwath&apos;s net ratings improved slightly (the gap between approval and disapproval shrunk by three points for Hudak, and increased by six points for Horwath), but this seems to be a case of Ontarians turning against McGuinty rather than towards another party or leader.<br /><br />But as has been the case in the past, it is difficult to know what to believe with this poll. It would not shock me in the slightest if Nanos Research released a new poll showing the New Democrats with less than 25% support and the Liberals and Tories still in a close race. The increase in NDP support has not been replicated at the federal level either, with the exception of a new poll by Environics. Aside from their results, the NDP is still hovering around 30% in the province (including in the most recent federal Forum poll) and hasn&apos;t experienced any sort of dramatic leap.<br /><br />Ontario remains a province to keep a close eye on, but the trends are not exactly clear. The New Democrats have had a good month with their by-election win in Kitchener-Waterloo and the Tories might be benefiting from the Liberals&apos; discomfiture by keeping their heads down. If numbers like these are confirmed in the coming months, the opposition parties might be more emboldened to take the government down in the spring. But the result of such an election could be a surprise.<img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/623376556094758746-4385386514649519244?l=www.threehundredeight.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',1348939336,NULL,NULL,'Ã‰ric','http://www.blogger.com/profile/06849352443716808247','2012-09-28T10:13:00.000-04:00',NULL,'ThreeHundredEight.com',NULL,'A new poll was released <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1262810--ontario-liberals-support-slumps-poll-finds\">by Forum Research yesterday for the <i>Toronto Star</i></a>, suggesting that the Progressive Conservatives and New Democrats are in a close race in Ontario.

If the Liberals still had a lot of support in Toronto but had dropped everywhere else, then the sort of result envisioned by Forum could be possible. But with only 22% support in their best region of the province, it just wouldn&apos;t happen.<br /><br />According to Forum, Dalton McGuinty&apos;s personal numbers have collapsed. He used to enjoy better approval ratings than the unloved Tim Hudak, but no more. His approval rating dropped nine points to only 20% and his disapproval increased by seven points to 67%. Even among the dwindling number of Liberal supporters his numbers have dropped by six points to 71% approval.<br /><br />That is not to say that Hudak has taken advantage of this. His numbers have held relatively steady, with an approval rating of 26% and a disapproval rating of 49%. The biggest shift came among PC voters - his approval rating was down five points to only 48% among his party&apos;s supporters.<br /><br />Andrea Horwath&apos;s numbers were also rather static, with her approval rating registering 48% and her disapproval rating dropping four points to 23%. Both Hudak and Horwath&apos;s net ratings improved slightly (the gap between approval and disapproval shrunk by three points for Hudak, and increased by six points for Horwath), but this seems to be a case of Ontarians turning against McGuinty rather than towards another party or leader.<br /><br />But as has been the case in the past, it is difficult to know what to believe with this poll. It would not shock me in the slightest if Nanos Research released a new poll showing the New Democrats with less than 25% support and the Liberals and Tories still in a close race. The increase in NDP support has not been replicated at the federal level either, with the exception of a new poll by Environics. Aside from their results, the NDP is still hovering around 30% in the province (including in the most recent federal Forum poll) and hasn&apos;t experienced any sort of dramatic leap.<br /><br />Ontario remains a province to keep a close eye on, but the trends are not exactly clear. The New Democrats have had a good month with their by-election win in Kitchener-Waterloo and the Tories might be benefiting from the Liberals&apos; discomfiture by keeping their heads down. If numbers like these are confirmed in the coming months, the opposition parties might be more emboldened to take the government down in the spring. But the result of such an election could be a surprise.<img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/623376556094758746-4385386514649519244?l=www.threehundredeight.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Posted','277','News','News',NULL),(672,0,0,'Sept. 29: button, button.......','text/html','http://themonctongrimes-dripdrain.blogspot.com/2012/09/sept-29-button-button.html','City',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-29 08:27:54',17,'Who&apos;s got the button?<br /><br />There was sort of a big story on CBC news yesterday. Norbert, I&apos;m sure, would have been interested in it. A number of oil companies face charges for price-fixing in Quebec. &amp;nbsp;(That&apos;s against the law, you know.) One of them was a company called Irving. The company was reported as having its headquarters in St. John. That&apos;s quite a coincidence. We have an oil company named Irving that has headquarters in St. John.( But it can&apos;t be the same one.)<br /><br />After all, if it were the Irving oil we all know, then The Moncton Times and Transcript would have had a big story about it. I mean, CBC had to the story out in plenty of time to make the press deadline. But I couldn&apos;t find a word about it, not even in the Miss Manners column. Even Rod Allen&apos;s Spies didn&apos;t know about it.<br /><br />And - well - just imagine - imagine the coverage if CBC had been charged with price-fixing. Well, that would have have front page, lead editorial, and a full op ed page by Norbert, foaming at the mouth. (Instead, he has a column about how you shouldn&apos;t try to sneak a ride on a plane by climbing into a wheel well. Way to tell it like it is, Norbert.)<br /><br />There was another story I didn&apos;t expect to see. But it was there - if only by accident. (It didn&apos;t appear as a news story. It appeared as an op ed piece by Gwynne Dyer.) &amp;nbsp;American drones which have routinely been killing people in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, etc. for several years, have been killing mostly civilians. That comes from a lengthy study carried out by Stanford University and New York University. (Certainly, it did not come from reading the TandT or Reuters.)<br /><br />In fact, the civilian dead come to almost 90% of the total score. One reason is the \"double tap\". The drone fires on a target, goes away, then come back as rescuers arrive at the scene - and it kills the rescuers. God Bless America. Almost all of the North American press has never reported on any of this. This random killing to create fear is precisely what we call terrorism when somebody else does it.<br /><br />On p. 1, Brent Mazerolle - well - I can kindly call this misleading reporting.<br /><br />The lead story \"Are we correct or cranky\" is about a survey which shows that Monctonians are profoundly unhappy with the quality of city services. The headline alone gives away his bias. (Correct or cranky suggests we might just be a bunch of malcontents. And the first, five paragraphs rub that point in. Nothing wrong with Moncton. Just a lot of cranks live here.)<br /><br />The focus is supposed to be on whether Moncton is a good place to raise children. Now, in fact, the Moncton Times and Transcipt has almost never had a good word to say about our public schools. It was not long ago that it ran the some of the most savage and ignorant editorials I have ever seen - and they were attacking our schools. I don&apos;t at all agree with that. But the TandT itself has taken a lead in saying this is not a good place to raise children. Now Brent writes off such critics as cranks. In fact, the only cranks I have seen write for the TandT.<br /><br />Bad reporting, Brent.<br /><br />Otherwise, Section A is a great read for lovers of car ads.<br /><br />NewsToday leads with a silly story about Trudeau, and how good looks are important in choosing a party leader. That&apos;s drivel. The line-up of Canadian prime ministers since 1867 will never be confused with the Mr. Canada contest. John A was homely. The longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history was Mackenzie-King who was short, overweight, homely as a post, utterly without charm, and without friends. Despite a lifetime search, he could never find a wife or even a girlfriend. John Diefenbaker? He may have sired an illegitimate son. But lots of homely people do that.<br /><br />Similarly, Belliveau gushes over Justin Trudeau, even over his very ordinary and rather scattered academic record. Belliveau also has a strange comment about the father and son. \"Justin Trudeau is a young man in tune with the times. He is not his father.\" &amp;nbsp;?????????<br /><br />Pierre Trudeau was not in tune with the times? And what the hell does being in tune with the times mean? What principles does Justin Trudeau stand for? Belliveau appears to be linking that statement to Justin&apos;s attitude to oil and shale gas development. Yessirree, maybe being in tune with the times means making all the money we can now without worrying about what the means for the world our children (and even most of us) will have to live in - maybe.<br /><br />Incidentally, Pierre Trudeau was neither handsome nor outgoing. He was, in fact, a very shy man, quite an introvert. But he could turn on an extroverted, take-charge personality as if by a switch. Those who thought him handsome were, I think, seeing a projection of his intellectual acuity and his confidence. He also had a far more serious academic record than Justin, and far more experience in dealing with public issues.<br /><br />If the Liberals can&apos;t come up with a few more candidates, and some demonstrated abilities, they&apos;re in trouble. In fact, it&apos;s not just a leader they need. It&apos;s some sense of what \"Liberal\" means.<br /><br />P. B7 has a story on how our provincial minister of mines and energy, Craig Leonard, is not in a conflict of interest, even though his sister has a senior position in the petroleum industry. (Mr. Leonard has said he wants to make New Brunswick an energy hub with --- well, guess --- firewood? &amp;nbsp;rubber bands? candles? shale gas?<br /><br /><br />Nope. No conflict of interest there. But read the article closely. It&apos;s so garbled that it&apos;s hard to follow. Are their rules for conflict of interest? &amp;nbsp;Does Mr. Allward have any moral or political position on this? I mean, he is the person who chooses ministers. If he thinks any choice is a bad idea, he has the power not to make it.&amp;nbsp;<br />But I can see the political appeal of Mr. Leonard. &amp;nbsp;The story ends with a &amp;nbsp;long statement from Mr. Leonard. And, oh, and can this guy talk political gobbledygook. You could cut out at least half of his words without changing the meaning. In fact, you could boil the whole thing down to four words. He likes shale gas.<br /><br />Oh! Something else the TandT forgot to report. It was announced yesterday that a group in New York had awarded the Richard Nixon prize to Harper. The prize is for courageous and strong leadership in protecting the interests of the rich and powerful.<br /><br />I remember the days, not that long ago, when Canada was one of the most respected &amp;nbsp;(if innocuous) countries in the world. Harper has singlehandedly destroyed that. In a recent South American poll of popular political leaders in the Americas, Harper came in 18th.<br /><br />In particular, his policy toward Israel is confusing, to say the least. Until today, he was holding to an Israel policy that seemed in conflict with that of Obama, and far closer to Netanyahu&apos;s demands for war. Indeed, Netanyahu, who is barely on speaking terms with Obama, sat down yesterday for a real kiss-up with Harper.<br /><br />I have been wondering for some time why Canada was following a policy that seemed to be a contradiction of Obama&apos;s. But today, Harper&apos;s on p. 1 playing kiss-kiss with Netanyahu while refusing to accept Netanyahu&apos;s demand for a red line against Iran. <br /><br />That&apos;s the same as Obama&apos;s policy. Yet Netanyahu is smiling and going kiss-kiss back on Harper.<br /><br />What&apos;s going on here? Why is Netanyahu furious with Obama but buddies with Harper?<br /><br />We are quite possibly on the edge of World War Three. Shouldn&apos;t we be thinking our way through to some clearer policy?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />5<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/373697047018228084-6720807068766300323?l=themonctongrimes-dripdrain.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',1348939443,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Sat, 29 Sep 2012 15:27:00 +0000',NULL,'The Moncton Times@Transcript - Good and Bad',NULL,'Who&apos;s got the button?<br /><br />There was sort of a big story on CBC news yesterday.

Alas! He seems to understand none of the issues - and seems not even to have read any significant commentary on it.<br /><br />The editorial, God help us, is about the closing of a restaurant. It&apos;s a restaurant I liked, going way back to its early days. Loved it. But a subject for an editorial?<br /><br />Three, very readable columns by Alec Bruce, Lynda MacGibbon, and David Suzuki. Bruce&apos;s column is a warning of what happens when a crown corporation (VIA Rail) is run by a government with a private corporation mind set. Lynda MacGibbon raises a point that Moncton should have been planning for twenty years ago - and that Riverview should have thought of from the start.<br /><br />Now, the painful part....<br /><br />On Tuesday, Oct. 2, at 7 p.m., the current events group will meet at Moncton Library on Main St. &amp;nbsp;All are welcome. (You will sometimes find it listed with other events in The Moncton Times and Transcript - but usually not.)<br /><br />The painful part? Well, this blog attracts a large readership. It&apos;s true that many readers are a long commute (the U.S., Russia, India...). &amp;nbsp;But the majority must almost certainly be from the Moncton area.<br /><br />I have led current events groups for over 15 years, with regular audiences that were rarely under 200, and commonly twice that. But, oh, Moncton is a tough gig. I have rarely had more than a very few, though usually the same ones. I don&apos;t understand how a large readership can translate into such a small discussion group.<br /><br />I seldom announce topics in advance because it&apos;s hard to know even a day in advance what will be important in the news. However, I am open to any suggestion for topics you would like to hear about. Just drop a note in the comments space below this post.<br /><br /><br /><img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/373697047018228084-4017256948123384031?l=themonctongrimes-dripdrain.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Posted','279','Opinion','Opinion',NULL),(674,0,0,'Globe &amp; Mail: Margaret Wente Suffered an &#8220;Originality Breakdown&#8221;','text/html','http://sixthestate.net/?p=6641','Media;Margaret Wente;Canada',NULL,NULL,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,14,'The Margaret Wente plagiarism saga continues.

Professional journalism certainly does have an originality problem. But that&#8217;s not what&#8217;s at issue here. We&#8217;re not accusing Wente of merely &#8220;relying too heavily on the work of others&#8221; (although she does that, too). Wente stands accused of plagiarism. Plagiarism isn&#8217;t just a lack of being original: it&#8217;s lifting material without attribution and/or quotes, and thus presenting it as though it were your own words. This is not, contrary to what one National Post columnist recently claimed, a new definition cooked up by radical bloggers. It&#8217;s bog-standard. It&#8217;s older than Wente.</p>\n<p>What <em>is </em>at issue is that, in addition to originality, professional journalism has a plagiarism problem. It has a plagiarism problem because some high-profile columnists allegedly plagiarize and, when this happens, other high-profile columnists sally forth in defence of their colleague, trumping up any number of pathetic and contradictory excuses: journalists are busy, the Internet makes it easy to copy and paste, there isn&#8217;t enough editorial supervision, there&#8217;s too <em>much</em> editorial supervision, it&#8217;s because young people don&#8217;t follow the same rules as their parents, it&#8217;s blah blah blah.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t good enough. It&#8217;s the 21st century, and the media is accountable to the people it serves. We <strong>demand </strong>that you hold yourself to certain standards, one of which is that you present the work of others as your own. Failing to provide full citations for every idea that ends up on the page is fine. Lifting sentences verbatim is <strong>not</strong> fine. Most of you are university graduates. Didn&#8217;t this come up at least once or twice in whatever institutions you got your degree from?</p>\n<p>McBride closes with what must be the least imaginative proposal for solutions ever:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Today&apos;s most original successful writers often combine the new and the old to foster their thinking.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s brilliant.</p>\n<p>While we&#8217;re on the subject of &#8220;originality breakdowns,&#8221; it&#8217;s worth <a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/09/27/editorial-oversight-globe-issues-new-mea-culpa-after-columnist-leah-mclaren-writes-article-trying-to-sell-her-house/\">pointing out</a> that a few days ago one of the Globe&#8217;s real estate columnists, Leah McLaren, blatantly used her <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/home-and-garden/real-estate/home-of-the-week-a-workers-cottage-built-for-family-life/article4556636/\">&#8220;Home of the Week&#8221; column to advertise her <strong>own </strong>home</a>, which is for sale. Just like Margaret Wente, the Globe&#8217;s editors are treating this appalling ethical lapse with the utmost seriousness.

The general tenor of commentary from pundits like those described above is that professional journalists are above accountability, that readers do not have the right to complain about their (apparent lack of) professional standards, and that they are simply far too busy and postmodern to be bothered by silly rules like &#8220;don&#8217;t plagiarize.&#8221; Ironically, in choosing to back their own rather than to defend their collective reputation, many of Canada&#8217;s journalists are implying what some of us believed all along: that for all our various faults, <strong>political bloggers actually have higher standards than professional reporters</strong>.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, I couldn&#8217;t think of much I could do, especially on my own. But I can do the following, as meaningless and trivial as it may be, and I encourage other bloggers to adopt this statement of principles as well (or at least to consider what other measures they will take):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When I mention a journalist who has repeatedly lifted material without attribution, especially from fellow bloggers, I will always add that fact in brackets, preferably with a link explaining why. For instance: Margaret Wente (<a href=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6606\">a documented plagiarist</a>). I&#8217;m considering whether the same thing should apply to any media organization that continues to employ plagiarists, across the board.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>When I mention a journalist who has defended plagiarism by fellow reporters, I will always state that fact, in line with the above. For instance: Terence Corcoran (who <a href=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6627\">defends plagiarism by fellow journalists</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>I will not link to any column by any plagiarist or defender of plagiarism, ever. If I feel the need to write about their columns, I will do so, as I have on many occasions before. I may write about it positively, when I think they&#8217;ve written something of decent quality. I may even quote from them, where appropriate. But no link juice. The moment you decided to defend plagiarism was the moment you exempted yourself from the privilege of full participation in the online community.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So far, the reporters I will be treating in this fashion are: <a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/09/25/margaret-wente-suspended-from-cbc-media-panel-after-plagiarism-row-over-globe-column/\">Margaret Wente</a> (obviously) of the <em>Globe &amp; Mail</em>, <a href=\"http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/09/24/margaret-wente-remix-artist/\">Jesse Brown</a> of Maclean&#8217;s, <a href=\"http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/09/27/terence-corcoran-on-margaret-wente-why-we-dont-need-public-editors/\">Terence Corcoran</a> of the National Post, <a href=\"http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/09/26/dan-delmar-self-righteous-sinners-cast-the-first-stone-at-margaret-wente/\">Dan Delmar</a> of the Post (and elsewhere), and <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1262116--tim-harper-the-perils-of-mainstream-journalism-in-the-social-media-era\">Tim Harper</a> of the Toronto Star. Unless any of them publicly recant of their views, the list will only grow, not shrink.</p>\n<p>I doubt any of them will care what a small humble blogger does. But I&#8217;m doing this out of principle, not because I think it will have any effect. I hope other bloggers will consider what they can do, as well.</p>\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6632\" data-text=\"Link Boycott of Pro-Plagiarism Journalists (Other Bloggers Welcome to Join In)\" data-count=\"horizontal\">Tweet</a>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Posted','281','Opinion','Opinion',NULL),(676,0,0,'Historic Syria market burned in fighting, activists say','text/html','http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/09/29/syria-aleppo-fighting-rebels-market-fire.html?cmp=rss','World',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,11,'<img width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"http://www.cbc.ca/gfx/images/news/topstories/2012/09/29/hi-syria-aleppo-medieval-city-852-6col.jpg\"><br/><p>Fires sparked by clashes between government troops and rebels raged through the medieval market in Aleppo, destroying hundreds of shops lining the vaulted passageways where foods, fabrics, perfumes and spices have been sold for centuries, activists say.</p>',1348946043,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Sat, 29 Sep 2012 15:06:40 EDT',NULL,'CBC | World News',NULL,'<img width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"http://www.cbc.ca/gfx/images/news/topstories/2012/09/29/hi-syria-aleppo-medieval-city-852-6col.jpg\"><br/><p>Fires sparked by clashes between government troops and rebels raged through the medieval market in Aleppo, destroying hundreds of shops lining the vaulted passageways where foods, fabrics, perfumes and spices have been sold for centuries, activists say.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,'News','News',NULL),(677,0,0,'Ex-NY Times publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger dies','text/html','http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/09/29/sulzberger-obit.html?cmp=rss','World',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,11,'<img width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"http://www.cbc.ca/gfx/images/news/photos/2012/09/29/hi-sulzberger-cp-03349270-6col.jpg\"><br/><p>Former New York Times publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, who led the newspaper to new levels of influence and profit while standing up for press freedom and editorial independence during some of the most significant moments in 20th-century journalism, died Saturday.

However it lacks one important facet: a fantasy league. With the uncertainty about whether or not my friends and I could carry out our dreams as armchair General Managers for fantasy hockey in the National Hockey League (NHL), we decided to jump ship to the United Kingdom&apos;s premier hockey league.</p> <hr /> <p><a href=\"http://argosy.mta.ca/index.php?q=article/knee-deep-eihl-hockey\"><strong>Click here for the original story from The Argosy</strong></a></p> <hr /> <p>So on the opening day of the EIHL season two friends of mine: Marshall Thomas and Bryce Works from St. Albert, Alberta and Belmont, NS respectively created the first annual EIHL Fantasy Hockey League. With team names like \"Five for Tea Time\" (Marshall), \"London Silly Nannies\" (Bryce), and the \"Titty Ho Express\" (myself) we dived head first into the world of English hockey. Titty Ho is an actual town name in England. Google it.</p> <p>How were our teams selected? We each get to choose two goalies (standard) but the forwards and defence get a bit trickier. We picked six forwards and four defencemen and tracked their point totals. Since the league is apparently full of players who like to beat the crap out of each other (this year&apos;s leader in penalty minutes through five games is American Hockey League dropout Benn Olson with 99), we also picked an additional three forwards and two defencemen to score points based solely on penalty minutes, with players gaining a point for every five penalty minutes.</p> <p>The EIHL has no big name talent. Heck, games are on weekends and the players hold down part-time jobs in the week. Regardless I developed a solid system for selecting my players.

However it lacks one important facet: a fantasy league. With the uncertainty about whether or not my friends and I could carry out our dreams as armchair General Managers for fantasy hockey in the National Hockey League (NHL), we decided to jump ship to the United Kingdom&apos;s premier hockey league.</p> <hr /> <p><a href=\"http://argosy.mta.ca/index.php?q=article/knee-deep-eihl-hockey\"><strong>Click here for the original story from The Argosy</strong></a></p> <hr /> <p>So on the opening day of the EIHL season two friends of mine: Marshall Thomas and Bryce Works from St. Albert, Alberta and Belmont, NS respectively created the first annual EIHL Fantasy Hockey League. With team names like \"Five for Tea Time\" (Marshall), \"London Silly Nannies\" (Bryce), and the \"Titty Ho Express\" (myself) we dived head first into the world of English hockey. Titty Ho is an actual town name in England. Google it.</p> <p>How were our teams selected? We each get to choose two goalies (standard) but the forwards and defence get a bit trickier. We picked six forwards and four defencemen and tracked their point totals. Since the league is apparently full of players who like to beat the crap out of each other (this year&apos;s leader in penalty minutes through five games is American Hockey League dropout Benn Olson with 99), we also picked an additional three forwards and two defencemen to score points based solely on penalty minutes, with players gaining a point for every five penalty minutes.</p> <p>The EIHL has no big name talent. Heck, games are on weekends and the players hold down part-time jobs in the week. Regardless I developed a solid system for selecting my players. I was happy to take Stuart MacRae from Sydney, Nova Scotia who played with the Devils. These Devils weren&apos;t from New Jersey, they are from Cardiff. I also selected a forward to count penalty minutes who happened too be named Jeff Hutchins, only because his name sort of resembled Geoff Hutchinson, my co-worker at <em>The Argosy</em> last year.</p> <p>I also picked Sylvain Cloutier based on the fact that he is related to former Vancouver Canucks goaltender Dan Cloutier.

The steal of the draft went to Marshall as he randomly discovered that former Moncton Wildcats goaltender Nicola Riopel signed with the Dundee Stars.</p> <p>Of course this league isn&apos;t perfect and my lack of knowledge on the league made my team suffer. My top defenceman, Jeff Mason was supposed to carry my defensive core. Nope, turns out he&apos;s playing in Switzerland this year, whoops.</p> <p>Are we crazy?

It hasn&#8217;t been pretty. First, the Globe unsuccessfully tried to dismiss the accusations as the <a href=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6594\">rantings of an anonymous blogger</a>. Later, reporters from other media offered a wide range of excuses for Wente, ranging from the intriguing thesis that <a href=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6606\">plagiarism is obsolete in the Internet age</a> to the rather ridiculous claim that accusing a reporter of plagiarism is akin to the <a href=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6627\">Maoist purges of the Cultural Revolution</a>. It&#8217;s bad enough that I&#8217;ve started a <a href=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6632\">link boycott of pro-plagiarism columnists</a>, and I encourage other bloggers to join me in this protest.</p>\n<p>However, I also want to highlight the ways in which it&#8217;s not all bad news. Some reporters &#8212; some rare few &#8212; have actually done their jobs over the last few days and, more importantly, have decided to put the reputation of their profession ahead of their desire to protect their own from public criticism. For instance, the CBC has taken the important step of <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1262202--cbc-suspends-margaret-wente-from-media-panel-following-plagiarism-allegations\">publicly booting Wente</a> from her position on a media panel while the allegations are investigated. The Globe &amp; Mail, notably, did not announce anything of the kind, although the fact that Wente hasn&#8217;t published another column since a paranoid semi-apology several days ago may be an indication that she&#8217;s on some sort of leave.</p>\n<p>Another thing the Globe didn&#8217;t do was to give a platform to the blogger at <a href=\"http://mediaculpapost.blogspot.ca/\">Media Culpa</a>, an Ottawa art professor named Carol Wainio, to explain her views. (Instead, it apparently preferred to engage in cheap shots at her reputation, at least until this was no longer a tenable position.) In contrast, the <a href=\"http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/09/28/carol-wainio-sorry-wente-and-corcoran-media-ethics-do-matter/\">National Post has done so</a>. It&#8217;s highly recommended reading, because she explains her motives for going after Wente, and simply because the Post was willing to give her the space. A <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1262167--blogger-carol-wainio-a-very-serious-professional-person\">Toronto Star interview</a> is also worth reading, for the same reason.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Star is also to be commended for having its public editor publish a piece on plagiarism which at least <strong>appears</strong> to take the problem seriously. This of course stands in marked contrast to the Globe public editor&#8217;s attempt to downplay the allegations, and the National Post&#8217;s blatant lack of a public editor in the first place (because, according to one of its leading columnists, media accountability is an assault on freedom of the press). <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/opinion/publiceditor/article/1263843--globe-plagiarism-scandal-a-test-for-public-editor\">Kathy English lays out what she thinks</a> are some of the key differences between how her office works at the Star, and how the public editor office works at the Globe &amp; Mail.</p>\n<p>Of course we shouldn&#8217;t kid ourselves about what&#8217;s going on here. The Globe&#8217;s decision to defend one of its high-profile columnists was sadly predictable. So is the willingness of the Globe&#8217;s competitors to slam it at any opportunity &#8212; and this is certainly the opportunity. The delayed response occurred because their instinct to rush in with swords drawn has been warring with a fear that there might be plagiarists in their own organizations who could be exposed. In contrast, the seemingly pro-plagiarism positions taken by people like Terence Corcoran at the Post and Jesse Brown at Maclean&#8217;s are at least principled, even if the principles they hold to are sometimesÂ asinine and contemptible.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, I await a full andÂ sincere expression of contrition from Ms. Wente, one that doesn&#8217;t wander off into gratuitous attacks on her critics.</p>\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http://sixthestate.net/?p=6653\" data-text=\"How the Media Should Handle a Plagiarism Scandal\"
