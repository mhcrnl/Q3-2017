I guess that&apos;s the sometime randomness of reflexivity, too, which also has a place as this is about our creative thinking processes which are &amp;nbsp;notoriously difficult to marshal and the text might well reflect that aspect...)</i>So, back to the article. Finlay first of all presents a brief history of reflexivity, showing how it has a firm place within the qualitative research agenda. She argues for &amp;nbsp;the researcher as \"a central figure who influences if not actively constructs, the collection, selection and interpretation of data\", going on to state that \"researchers no longer question the need for reflexivity: the question is how to do it\" (2002, 212). And there is a &apos;how&apos;, as she offers five maps of different variants of reflexivity as:<ol><li>Introspection</li><li>intersubjective reflection</li><li>mutual collaboration</li><li>social critique</li><li>ironic deconstruction<o:p></o:p></li></ol><h3> 1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Reflexivity as introspection<o:p></o:p></h3>The terrain here is of personal revelation, not as an end in itself, but as a springboard for more general insight and interpretations â€“ Finlay quotes Maslow (1966), who asserted &apos;\"there is no substitute for experience, none at all\", pointing researchers towards the value of self-dialogue and discovery. <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">I also wonder if there might be a place for creative expression in research, too â€“ what might be the place of a short fiction or a poem to express the reflexive standpoint of a person, especially with something as elusive as introspection? I&apos;m also pleased to see a discussion of the work of Moustakas (1990), who is a significant writer in the person-centred approach. <o:p></o:p></i><br /> <br /><h3>2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Reflexivity as intersubjective reflection </h3>This is where researchers explore the mutual meanings emerging within the research relationship, focusing on the situated and negotiated nature of the research encounter. Highly significant here are the attitudes and demeanour of the researcher, highlighting the danger of limited participation in the research due to the researcher being perceived as an authority figure(216). <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">This resonates beautifully with the person-centred approach, which emphasises realness on the part of the facilitator/therapist/researcher, a down-playing of roles, a relinquishing of authority.</i> <o:p></o:p>This type of reflexivity goes beyond an examination of self towards that of self-in-relation-to-others. Linda moves to italics to profess her own ease with this type of reflexivity, where, as a therapist,&amp;nbsp; \"it is second nature to examine my own motivations as a way of understanding another\" (218). The danger here is that such complex dynamics and unconscious motivations can be accessed in the first place. <br /><br /><h3>3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Reflexivity as Mutual Collaboration</h3>This type of reflexivity centrally enlists researchers as co-participants. <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">This is my favourite, and one I&apos;ve tried, as it doesn&apos;t come more person-centred than this â€“ research &apos;with&apos; people rather than &apos;on&apos; people.</i> The key point here is the recognition of research participants as reflexive beings themselves â€“ and so co-researchers who are involved in a reflexive dialogue during data analysis or evaluation. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s worth quoting Finlay&apos;s â€“ <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">it feels so, well, RUDE to not refer to &apos;Linda&apos;, but I&apos;m trying to maintain that academic register, as well as, I guess, not assuming an intimacy I don&apos;t have with the author</i> â€“ summary of this style:<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\"Collaborative reflexivity offers the opportunity to hear, and take into account, multiple voices and conflicting positions. While the notion of shared realities finds favour with many researchers, some still challenge an egalitarian rhetoric where it disguises essentially unequal relationships.\" (220) </blockquote><h3>4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Reflexivity as Social Critique</h3>It is that last issue of unequal power relationships which is taken up in the fourth variant of reflexivity, which openly acknowledges tensions arising from different social positions, for instance, class, gender and race. This kind of analysis is rooted in strong theoretical frameworks about the social construction of power. <o:p></o:p><h3>5.   Reflexivity as Discursive Deconstruction</h3>This final variant would accuse the previous two as claiming even more authority by saying you&apos;ve attended to the power dimension. Instead, reflexivity here pays attention to the ambiguity of meanings in language used and to how this impacts on modes of presentation.&amp;nbsp; \"Researchers for this tradition would notice how both participants and researchers are engaged in an exercise of &apos;presenting&apos; themselves to each other â€“ and to the wider community which is to receive the research.\" (223)So, these are the various maps â€“ Finlay goes on to show the value of reflexivity taken as a whole:<ul><li>&amp;nbsp;examine the impact of the position, perspective and presence of the researcher</li><li>&amp;nbsp;promote rich insight through examining personal responses and interpersonal dynamics</li><li>&amp;nbsp;open up unconscious motivations and implicit biases in the researcher&apos;s approach </li><li>&amp;nbsp;empower others by opening up a more radical consciousness</li><li>&amp;nbsp;evaluate the research process, method and outcomes</li><li>&amp;nbsp;enable public scrutiny of the integrity of the research through offering a methodological log of research decisions.</li></ul>(Finlay, 2002)<o:p></o:p><br /><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">Reference</b>: Finlay, L.

The danger here is that such complex dynamics and unconscious motivations can be accessed in the first place. <br /><br /><h3>3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Reflexivity as Mutual Collaboration</h3>This type of reflexivity centrally enlists researchers as co-participants. <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">This is my favourite, and one I&apos;ve tried, as it doesn&apos;t come more person-centred than this â€“ research &apos;with&apos; people rather than &apos;on&apos; people.</i> The key point here is the recognition of research participants as reflexive beings themselves â€“ and so co-researchers who are involved in a reflexive dialogue during data analysis or evaluation. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s worth quoting Finlay&apos;s â€“ <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">it feels so, well, RUDE to not refer to &apos;Linda&apos;, but I&apos;m trying to maintain that academic register, as well as, I guess, not assuming an intimacy I don&apos;t have with the author</i> â€“ summary of this style:<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\"Collaborative reflexivity offers the opportunity to hear, and take into account, multiple voices and conflicting positions. While the notion of shared realities finds favour with many researchers, some still challenge an egalitarian rhetoric where it disguises essentially unequal relationships.\" (220) </blockquote><h3>4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Reflexivity as Social Critique</h3>It is that last issue of unequal power relationships which is taken up in the fourth variant of reflexivity, which openly acknowledges tensions arising from different social positions, for instance, class, gender and race. This kind of analysis is rooted in strong theoretical frameworks about the social construction of power. <o:p></o:p><h3>5.   Reflexivity as Discursive Deconstruction</h3>This final variant would accuse the previous two as claiming even more authority by saying you&apos;ve attended to the power dimension. Instead, reflexivity here pays attention to the ambiguity of meanings in language used and to how this impacts on modes of presentation.&amp;nbsp; \"Researchers for this tradition would notice how both participants and researchers are engaged in an exercise of &apos;presenting&apos; themselves to each other â€“ and to the wider community which is to receive the research.\" (223)So, these are the various maps â€“ Finlay goes on to show the value of reflexivity taken as a whole:<ul><li>&amp;nbsp;examine the impact of the position, perspective and presence of the researcher</li><li>&amp;nbsp;promote rich insight through examining personal responses and interpersonal dynamics</li><li>&amp;nbsp;open up unconscious motivations and implicit biases in the researcher&apos;s approach </li><li>&amp;nbsp;empower others by opening up a more radical consciousness</li><li>&amp;nbsp;evaluate the research process, method and outcomes</li><li>&amp;nbsp;enable public scrutiny of the integrity of the research through offering a methodological log of research decisions.</li></ul>(Finlay, 2002)<o:p></o:p><br /><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">Reference</b>: Finlay, L.

As it happens, the choice of Carl Rogers&apos; approach is serendipitous when considering rehumanising the personal learning experience. Rogers took the central principles of his theory and applied them to contexts other than the therapy room â€“ including, to education.<a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=3680182410838117036#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" style=\"mso-endnote-id: edn2;\" title=\"\">OPENBLOCKiiCLOSEBLOCK</a> Rogers shows how learning can involve a change in our perception of self and so can very often be perceived as threatening - and so, resisted. I guess readers are very familiar with this when technology is added to the mix. Therefore, to make learning possible, external threats must be minimised so that significant learning can take place. This means a change in roles as we have understood them in &apos;formal&apos; education and in the power-relations that are often the context for &apos;informal&apos; workplace learning:Â·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The learner needs to be empowered and have control over the learning processÂ·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The teacher gives up much of their authority and becomes a facilitator. This is not an easy task. However, Rogers has given us the means by focusing on the facilitator, whose main task is to create a warm, welcoming, unconditional space in which learners feel they have the freedom to be themselves, take ownership of their learning, and work creatively and collaboratively with other learners. The most important element is the attitudes the facilitator takes, how s/he is existentially - and these are:Â·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Be a real person, Â·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Empathise with learners (understand their point of view), Â·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Trust (or prize) learners. The goal of a person-centred approach to learning is to create an atmosphere that promotes a person&apos;s inherent self-actualising tendency so that learners wish to learn, want to grow, and desire to create. I finish with the same quote from Albert Einstein that Rogers uses to front <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Freedom to Learn</i>: \"It is in fact nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need of freedom; without this it goes to wrack and ruin without fail.\" I&apos;m certainly not going to argue with Einstein. <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\" /><br /><a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=3680182410838117036#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" style=\"mso-endnote-id: edn1;\" title=\"\">OPENBLOCKiCLOSEBLOCK</a> Like any simple idea, it is easy to parody and, indeed, there was an even harsher parody from the 1940s where a suicidal &apos;patient&apos; in therapy eventually says \"I&apos;m opening the window Dr Rogers\"/\"I see, you&apos;re opening the window\"/\"I&apos;m about to jump\"/U-uhm.

Rogers took the central principles of his theory and applied them to contexts other than the therapy room â€“ including, to education.<a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=3680182410838117036#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" style=\"mso-endnote-id: edn2;\" title=\"\">OPENBLOCKiiCLOSEBLOCK</a> Rogers shows how learning can involve a change in our perception of self and so can very often be perceived as threatening - and so, resisted. I guess readers are very familiar with this when technology is added to the mix. Therefore, to make learning possible, external threats must be minimised so that significant learning can take place. This means a change in roles as we have understood them in &apos;formal&apos; education and in the power-relations that are often the context for &apos;informal&apos; workplace learning:Â·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The learner needs to be empowered and have control over the learning processÂ·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The teacher gives up much of their authority and becomes a facilitator. This is not an easy task. However, Rogers has given us the means by focusing on the facilitator, whose main task is to create a warm, welcoming, unconditional space in which learners feel they have the freedom to be themselves, take ownership of their learning, and work creatively and collaboratively with other learners. The most important element is the attitudes the facilitator takes, how s/he is existentially - and these are:Â·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Be a real person, Â·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Empathise with learners (understand their point of view), Â·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Trust (or prize) learners. The goal of a person-centred approach to learning is to create an atmosphere that promotes a person&apos;s inherent self-actualising tendency so that learners wish to learn, want to grow, and desire to create. I finish with the same quote from Albert Einstein that Rogers uses to front <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Freedom to Learn</i>: \"It is in fact nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need of freedom; without this it goes to wrack and ruin without fail.\" I&apos;m certainly not going to argue with Einstein. <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\" /><br /><a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=3680182410838117036#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" style=\"mso-endnote-id: edn1;\" title=\"\">OPENBLOCKiCLOSEBLOCK</a> Like any simple idea, it is easy to parody and, indeed, there was an even harsher parody from the 1940s where a suicidal &apos;patient&apos; in therapy eventually says \"I&apos;m opening the window Dr Rogers\"/\"I see, you&apos;re opening the window\"/\"I&apos;m about to jump\"/U-uhm.

This is what I thing it should work. Every one sharing their knowledge to do a unit. But after filling the <a title=\"Beginners Questionnaire\" href=\"http://lisahistory.net/pot/BeginnersQuestionnaire.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">questionnaire</a>Â and watching the <a title=\"Lisa&apos;s Video\" href=\"http://mccpot.org/wp/2012/03/self-paced-where-the-hell-do-i-start/\" target=\"_blank\">Lisa&#8217;s video</a>Â I saw some contradictions, because my answers didn&#8217;t fit with it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Assessment myself, this is what I am doing beginning of week 2 of the Pot Cert proposal. To fill in a questionnaire and to evaluate the results. So simple? Not when the obtained results are not what you think you should have. This make moving your head from one side to the other, checking the questionnaire and the answers to ensure everything is right. And the result remain equal. You are on the right side of the line. This is not bad or good itself, the problem is when you think you are in the left side/middle and you confirmed you are in the right.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Howsoever I am not actually a teacher, so this is not only to see what kind of teacher I am, better is what kind of teacher I would be. So, really, I am starting from the beginning and I can improve to the best proposal, if there is a best proposal, of course.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Talking about my matter, philosophy, I think that the best is to be at the right side, that means <em>providing a big amount of content to the students</em>Â but, after some reflection about the drawings Lisa linked, I think there is good a second step where the students could take part of the teacher&#8217;s role and produce and drive the class and the materials, andÂ <em>introduce discussions in the class.Â </em>So probably I would move toÂ <em>a combination of lectures and discussions.</em> Then there are several proposals for the activities I am sure I will reflect about. But the main thing is that I would do a two step proposal, giving as much materials as possible, not only lectures but also videos and other internet material as a first; and a second step where the students were able to share their experiences and thoughts after attending all of these lectures.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">So, I think correct would be a little bit more to the left than my 19. I saw I am very prescriptive, probably because my inexperience, and I think that I should be a little bit less and give more flexibility to the students with this second step. There was a very interesting reflection for me because, with this short questionnaire and drawing, I saw that I was thinking to do the same teaching I received in the university, and I always critiziced, and permit me to understand and see a different way of teaching.</p>\n<br /> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=filosofiadebolsillo.wordpress.com&#038;blog=28508677&#038;post=792&#038;subd=filosofiadebolsillo&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(26,0,0,'POT cert presentation &#8211; Week 1','text/html','http://filosofiadebolsillo.wordpress.com/2012/09/02/pot-cert-presentation-week-1/','EducaciÃ³n;Internet;MOOC;TIC;moocmooc;potcert;Week 1',NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,4,'I would like to say hello to my peers in the Program for Online Teaching Certificate.

Please fell free to take a walk in my blog and to comment.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I am a graduate in philosophy but my work nowadays has nothing to be with it or with education. This is why I am preparing myself with this and other courses. This academic year, as I explained in my <a title=\"Next academic course / PrÃ³ximo cursoÂ acadÃ©mico\" href=\"http://filosofiadebolsillo.wordpress.com/2012/08/27/next-academic-course-proximo-curso-academico/\" target=\"_blank\">previous post</a>, I will take a MA in the Teachers School of the <a title=\"UB\" href=\"http://www.ub.edu/web/ub/en/index.html?\" target=\"_blank\">Universitat de Barcelona</a>Â to be a Philosophy Teacher in the secondary School.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Normally I like very much reading philosophy, specially ancient greek philosophy ( I like very much Plato, Socrates and Aristotle), and contemporary continental tradition, hermeneutic-phenomenologic (Husserl, Heidegger and Gadamer), but this is only with paper books. I do not use the web to read about philosophy, to be honest I donÂ´t know exactly why, I will explore it. Now I am reading a lot about education, learning, e-learning and MOOC&#8217;s, specially on the web.Â I am excited to received and start reading the course book, although I think I will receive it with some delay because I booked it last week.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I like very much internet and social media and technologies and also I am enthusiastic with philosophy online teaching and also a discipline called digital humanities. This is why I decide to do this course. I saw that some of you had participate in theÂ <a title=\"Social Media and Open Education\" href=\"http://eci831.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Social media and open education</a> course and other courses, so most of you have a lot of experience in education and also in education online courses. I am sure I will follow you and, at the end, I hope I could collaborate with some online courses. The way I read on the internet is by following hashtag that are of my interest. I am using <a title=\"Diigo\" href=\"http://www.diigo.com\" target=\"_blank\">Diigo</a>Â to bookmark and save by tags all the pages of my interest.Â Actually I read about higher education, <a title=\"Diigo HigherEducation\" href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/xavcap/highereducation\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>Â some of the articles, about digital humanities (DH), <a title=\"Diigo Digital Humanities\" href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/xavcap/digitalhumanities\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>Â some articles and some information about DH MA. I am interested in the DH Pedagogy. To end this short resume about my reading interest, I like very much to read articles about MOOC&#8217;s, just to try to understand what is happening with this <em>new education alternative</em>, because I think that the MOOC&#8217;s has a lot of interest to develop to the learners during a long period after the university, <a title=\"MOOC`s\" href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/xavcap/MOOCS\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>Â you can find some articles about what a MOOC is.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I hope we can participate all together in the blogs with comments but also in twitter with the tag <a title=\"#potcert\" href=\"https://twitter.com//search/?q=%23potcert&amp;src=hash\" target=\"_blank\">#potcert</a> and in the Facebook group.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">See you online.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n<br /> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=filosofiadebolsillo.wordpress.com&#038;blog=28508677&#038;post=727&#038;subd=filosofiadebolsillo&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(27,0,0,'Embedding Test for Youtube, Slideshare and Flickr','text/html','http://filosofiadebolsillo.wordpress.com/2012/08/29/embedding-test-for-youtube-and-slideshare/','Sin categorÃ­a;test',NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,4,'Digital Reality from Chris Schaumann<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=filosofiadebolsillo.wordpress.com&#038;blog=28508677&#038;post=713&#038;subd=filosofiadebolsillo&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',1347449172,NULL,NULL,'FilodeBolsillo','http://filosofiadebolsillo.wordpress.com','Wed, 29 Aug 2012 16:01:32 +0000',NULL,'FilosofÃ­a de Bolsillo',NULL,'<iframe src=&apos;http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/81094&apos; width=&apos;427&apos; height=&apos;350&apos; scrolling=&apos;no&apos;></iframe>\n<strong> <a title=\"Digital Reality\" href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/chriss/digital-reality\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Reality</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/chriss\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Schaumann</a></strong>\n<p><a href=\"http://filosofiadebolsillo.wordpress.com/2012/08/29/embedding-test-for-youtube-and-slideshare/\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/Pa5_Qf7dh3Q/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/xavcap/7010387875/in/photostream\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7098/7010387875_c470d517ff_n.jpg\" alt=\"Portalada\" width=\"214\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/10123995@N04/923344988/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1295/923344988_3ee8e83e3f_n.jpg\" alt=\"Medieval Manor\" width=\"217\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<br /> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=filosofiadebolsillo.wordpress.com&#038;blog=28508677&#038;post=713&#038;subd=filosofiadebolsillo&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(28,0,0,'My MOOCMOOC reflections.','text/html','http://filosofiadebolsillo.wordpress.com/2012/08/29/my-moocmooc-reflections/','MOOC;ReflexiÃ³n;TIC;moocmooc',NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,4,'After reading thisÂ postÂ by @martinlugtonÂ and this other by @RosemarySewart, both MOOCMOOC participants, I thought that, at least, I owe a post to the MOOCMOOC people of theÂ course I took during this moth.

Este nuevo es un programa para enseÃ±ar online, <a title=\"POT\" href=\"http://pedagogyfirst.org/wppf12/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>POT (Program for Online Teaching)</em></strong></a>. El programa se desarrollarÃ¡ en 24 semanas, 12 semanas de Septiembre a Noviembre, y 12 mÃ¡s de Febrero a Abril.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Pienso que los 3 cursos, dos de ellos <em>MOOC</em>, y este tercero <em>OOC (Open Online Class), </em>se van a complementar muy bien y que van a ser una magnÃ­fica oportunidad para relacionar unos con otros, y estos con el MÃ¡ster, y todo teniendo un nexo comÃºn, la<strong> educaciÃ³n</strong> en general, y la <strong>educaciÃ³n online de las humanidades</strong>, que es el motivo de mi interÃ©s, en particular.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Como quiera que los dos cursos anteriores se van a solapar con este y, probablemente, con otros posts del mÃ¡ster, intentarÃ© hacer una buena gestiÃ³n de etiquetas.

Por otro lado he sustituido este por otro curso, este ofrecido por la <em><a title=\"Athabascau University\" href=\"http://www.athabascau.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Universidad de Athabasca</a>Â </em>y que forma parte del <a title=\"MeD\" href=\"http://cde.athabascau.ca/programs/mde.php\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>MÃ¡ster de EducaciÃ³n en EducaciÃ³n a Distancia, (MeD)</strong></a>.

Para el segundo que empezarÃ¡ a partir de finales de Enero y que durarÃ¡ 5 semanas todavÃ­a no hay seguimiento. InformarÃ© antes del comienzo del curso.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Â¿CÃ³mo estoy preparando los cursos?</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">El objetivo principal de cualquier curso deberÃ­a ser aprender. El objetivo,Â prÃ¡cticamenteÂ el Ãºnico, de un MOOC es aprender Â¿por quÃ© digo esto? Pues porque debido a que la mayorÃ­a de los cursos, todo y ser impartidos por expertos en las materias y por prestigiosas universidades, no dan un certificado del trabajo realizado ni de seguimiento del curso, <strong><em>aprender</em></strong> se convierte en finalidad casi exclusiva. Aunque esto no es del todo cierto si pensamos en que <em><strong>compartir</strong>Â </em>en nuestros blocs y en nuestros twitters, con infinidad de participantes, todo aquello que vayamos asimilando, es tambiÃ©n un objetivo, pues asÃ­ iremos avanzando en nuestro aprendizaje. A la vez los alumnos se convierten en profesores, aportando material y avanzando en lo propuesto por los profesores, y estos se convierten en alumnos,Â impregnÃ¡ndoseÂ con los comentarios de miles de participantes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Por otro lado en los cursos se describen una serie de herramientas que van a ser las que los participantes van a utilizar para la creaciÃ³n de sus propios contenidos. Para ello se ha de estar habituado a la navegaciÃ³n web, visualizaciÃ³n de vÃ­deos, identificaciÃ³n y guardado (marcado) de las pÃ¡ginas web que creamos interesantes tanto para seguir el curso como para la producciÃ³n de nuestro Â material. Por supuesto serÃ¡n necesarias cuentas en algÃºn servicio de blogging para la creaciÃ³n de un blog, y en twitter, FaceBook, o cualquier otro servicio deÂ InternetÂ con el que trabajemos.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">He cambiado mi gestor de marcadores <em>Delicious </em>por<em> Diigo.Â </em>La ventaja de este es que, ademÃ¡s de poder poner <em>tag</em> a todas las webs guardadas, puedes poner notas, marcar con fluorescente aquellas partes del texto que mÃ¡s te han interesado y guardar una imagen de la pÃ¡gina o de una selecciÃ³n de la misma. Facilitando asÃ­ identificar el motivo por el que guardamos la pÃ¡gina cuando lo hicimos.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">El trabajo principal es pues utilizar las herramientas propuestas. Trabajar con ellas, sobre ellas, y al lado de nuestros miles de compaÃ±eros repartidos por todo el mundo. Y, a elecciÃ³n de cada uno de los participantes, compartirlas con el resto como yo ya estoy haciendo.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n<br /> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=filosofiadebolsillo.wordpress.com&#038;blog=28508677&#038;post=620&#038;subd=filosofiadebolsillo&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(31,0,0,'MOOC.

Pocas lecturas despuÃ©s, y no pocos enlaces clicados, pude darme cuenta de que ya existÃ­a y eran lasÂ <strong>Humanidades digitales<em>.</em> </strong>Viene a ser un humanista adaptado a los tiempos de las TIC. El tema no es reducido, todo lo contrario, tiene su componente principal en un trabajo interdisciplinar y en la inclusiÃ³n de profesionales de diferentes disciplinas. Un proyecto de humanidades digitales estÃ¡ compuesto, normalmente, por informÃ¡ticos, bibliotecarios, filÃ³logos, y otros, dependiendo del tipo de proyecto. En otro artÃ­culo de mÃ­ bloc intento hacer una descripciÃ³n de un pequeÃ±o proyecto, mÃ¡s bien una <a title=\"Una aplicaciÃ³n de HumanidadesÂ Digitales\" href=\"http://filosofiadebolsillo.wordpress.com/2012/07/16/una-aplicacion-de-humanidades-digitales/\" target=\"_blank\">aplicaciÃ³n</a>, de humanidades digitales. Esta fue la primera ola cogida. El surf se me estaba dando bien este verano.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">DespuÃ©s de haber surfeado una ola uno requiere seguir practicando y el verano estÃ¡ siendo caluroso. Los clics se iban sucediendo, <a title=\"Delicious Wikipedia\" href=\"http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious\" target=\"_blank\">Delicious</a> empezaba a estar cargado con tags de <em><a title=\"Declicious - Digital Humanities\" href=\"http://www.delicious.com/xavcap/digitalhumanities\" target=\"_blank\">digital humanities</a></em>, <a title=\"Delicious - Recursos\" href=\"http://www.delicious.com/xavcap/recursos\" target=\"_blank\">recursos</a>, <a title=\"Delicious - Blocs\" href=\"http://www.delicious.com/xavcap/blogs\" target=\"_blank\">blocs</a>, <a title=\"Delicious - DigitalizaciÃ³n\" href=\"http://www.delicious.com/xavcap/digitalizaciÃ³n\" target=\"_blank\">digitalizaciÃ³n</a>, y algunos mÃ¡s. Y una ola trae otra ola, y las humanidades digitales dejan entrever los <strong>MOOC</strong>, <em>massive open online course</em>, o lo que es lo mismo,Â curso online abierto y masivo<em>.</em>Â Para saber mÃ¡s sobre los MOOC aconsejo la visualizaciÃ³n del siguiente <a title=\"VÃ­deo MOOC\" href=\"http://youtu.be/eW3gMGqcZQc\" target=\"_blank\">vÃ­deo</a>. Me adentro en ellos a partir del seguimiento un curso de <strong><a title=\"MOOC de MOOC`s\" href=\"http://www.moocmooc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MOOC de MOOCÂ´s</a>. </strong>El<strong>Â </strong>curso me introduce de lleno en las interioridades de un MOOC, mÃ¡xime porquÃ© todos, o la mayorÃ­a de los asistentes, son acadÃ©micos de universidades, principalmente americanas. Uno piensa en un principio que se trata de un curso online, un curso e-learning, pero es eso y mucho mÃ¡s. Tras mi seguimiento del curso me propongo seguir investigando, con el surfeo sistemÃ¡tico de las olas googlelianas. DespuÃ©s de las lecturas de bastantes, muchos, muchÃ­simos artÃ­culos al respecto y de la visualizaciÃ³n de no pocos vÃ­deos; acerca <a title=\"Buenos y malos MOOC&apos;s\" href=\"http://chronicle.com/blogs/brainstorm/good-moocs-bad-moocs/50361\" target=\"_blank\">de los buenos y malos MOOC`s</a>Â o de <a title=\"College Credit without College\" href=\"http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/05/07/prior-learning-assessment-catches-quietly\" target=\"_blank\">crÃ©ditos universitarios sin universidades</a>, entre otro muchos, y de leer sobre el sistema universitario americano, encuentro que algunas de las mejores universidades americanas, Harvard o MIT, entre otras se han lanzado a la organizaciÃ³n de MOOC&#8217;s. El <a title=\"Harvard and M.I.T. Team Up to Offer Free Online Courses\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/03/education/harvard-and-mit-team-up-to-offer-free-online-courses.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1345463599-mBZ4Wn5naF2+tLU4SqLjQw\" target=\"_blank\">artÃ­culo</a> que comenta esto no tiene desperdicio y me anima a seguir investigando el asunto. Universidades como Standford, Princeton, Pensilvania o Michigan anuncian tambiÃ©n su participaciÃ³n en proyectos similares y esto me lleva a su proyecto, <a title=\"Coursera Wikipedia \" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursera\" target=\"_blank\">Coursera</a>. Una web en la que las citadas universidades, y prestigiosos profesores de las mismas, ofrecen MOOC&#8217;s. Mi introducciÃ³n en los MOOC&#8217;s me ha llevado por las lecturas interesantes sobre sistemas de evaluaciÃ³n de MOOC&#8217;s y a descubrir la propuestaÂ <a title=\"Open Education\" href=\"http://openeducation.us/\" target=\"_blank\">educaciÃ³n abierta</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Seguro que me dejo cosas. He descubierto, por ejemplo,Â <strong><a title=\"Storify Wikipedia \" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storify\" target=\"_blank\">Storify</a></strong>, un interesante recurso que permite describir un proyecto aÃ±adiendo comentarios de otras redes sociales, como por ejemplo mi descubrimiento de las <a title=\"Storify - XavCap\" href=\"http://storify.com/XavCap/humanidades-digitales-agosto-2012\" target=\"_blank\">humanidades digitales</a>Â durante este verano.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Finalmente decido seguir dos cursos MOOC, uno ofrecido por coursera,Â <strong><a title=\"E-Learning and digital cultures\" href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/edc\" target=\"_blank\">E-learning and Digital Cultures</a>,Â </strong>con un programa Â de la Universidad de Edimburgo y otro, este en espaÃ±ol, despuÃ©s de hacer una bÃºsqueda entre la poca informaciÃ³n que hay al respecto en castellano, de la Universidad de Alicante,<a title=\"IntroducciÃ³n al desarrollo web\" href=\"http://idesweb.es/\" target=\"_blank\">Â </a><strong><a title=\"IntroducciÃ³n al desarrollo web\" href=\"http://idesweb.es/\" target=\"_blank\">iDESWEB: IntroducciÃ³n al desarrollo web</a>.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">AsÃ­ que durante los meses que siguen, el primer curso es de Septiembre a Diciembre, y el segundo de Febrero a Marzo, mis post o artÃ­culos van a hacer referencia a estos cursos y a otros blocs, hashtag twitter, vÃ­deos y, mÃ¡s que probablemente, a otros compaÃ±eros de cursos y los recursos de seguimiento que usen.</p>\n<br /> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=filosofiadebolsillo.wordpress.com&#038;blog=28508677&#038;post=578&#038;subd=filosofiadebolsillo&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(32,0,0,'Comer con cuchara grande','text/html','http://filosofiadebolsillo.wordpress.com/2012/08/13/comer-con-cuchara-grande/','EducaciÃ³n;FilosofÃ­a;PolÃ­tica;ReflexiÃ³n',NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,4,'ElÂ espÃ­ritu del pensamientoÂ crÃ­ticoÂ tiene que situarse por encima de las capacidades del estudiante cuando este se acerca a la universidad, esa es la requisiciÃ³n, como los requisitos que debe cumplir un proyecto y que son enviados al ingeniero.

ElÂ <em>objetivo</em>Â es conseguir que el alumno que se acerca a la gran escuela, esa que se quieren cargar, tengaÂ <em>eso</em>Â con anterioridad y que lo desarrolle en lo posible durante sus estudios, para que, posteriormente, esas habilidades le sirvan para el desarrollo de su vida comoÂ <em>buen ciudadano</em>Â en nuestra sociedad.<em>Â Habilidades de anÃ¡lisis crÃ­ticoÂ </em>en literatura, en ciencia o en filosofÃ­a, con el fin, a lo largo de las asignaturas y de la carrera o mÃ¡ster, de poder entonar su propio discurso, analizar lo que dicen los textos, si es que lo consigue, con la ayuda, guÃ­a y direcciÃ³n de los profesores,Â <em>autÃ©nticos conocedores</em>Â de la materia, a la postre ser mÃ¡s reflexivo, menos crÃ©dulo y estar mejor informado. DespuÃ©s unos con mÃ¡s suerte y otros con menos van encontrando hueco en el mercado laboral. Unos con mucha suerte en el sector para el que se han preparado, otros con menos suerte en otros ambientes, y los mÃ¡s, especialmente en estos momentos, no encuentran nada. No obstante todos, despuÃ©s de estudiar una carrera, la que sea, y de encontrar un trabajo, o no encontrarlo, sea el sector que sea, nos encontramos ante la misma sociedad.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">En mi casa me enseÃ±aron a comer con respeto al resto de comensales, lo mismo que intento hacer con mis hijas. No comas muy rÃ¡pido, no abras mucho la boca, no hagas ruido. En cierta manera eseÂ <em>espÃ­ritu crÃ­tico</em>Â del que hablaba empieza a trabajarse en la mesa, con la familia, con aquellos profesores de infantil o primaria que nos animaban a gritar, o callar, o bailar. EseÂ <em>espÃ­ritu crÃ­tico</em>Â que nos invita a pensar con independencia de lo que nos dicten.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Hoy dÃ­a todos los ciudadanos intentamos entender que estÃ¡ pasando. AquelÂ <em>espÃ­ritu crÃ­tico</em>Â se ha convertido, al final, en una guÃ­a de buenas prÃ¡cticas, en un no hacer daÃ±o al vecino y a tratarlo con respeto, en un comer pausadamente, sin abrir mucho la boca y sin hacer ruido. Y lo mismo pide cada uno de nosotros a nuestros semejantes y compaÃ±eros de esta sociedad que nos ha tocado vivir.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">La situaciÃ³n parece ser contraria cuando uno mira hacia arriba, hacia los dirigentes, sean del color que sean. Uno ve queÂ <em>comen con cucharas grandes,</em><em>Â </em>mascullando y riendo a carcajada entre cucharada y cucharada, abriendo mucho la boca y haciendo mucho ruido, con una falta total de respeto a los demÃ¡s. No aprendieron nada de eseÂ <em>espÃ­ritu crÃ­tico</em>Â que les debÃ­a haber acompaÃ±ado a lo largo de su vida, con su familia, con sus primeros maestros y, los que lo hayan conseguido, con sus profesores en la universidad. Ese <em>espÃ­ritu crÃ­tico</em> que les hubiera hecho mejorar como personas.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Me han enseÃ±ado a comer con cuchara pequeÃ±a, a no llenarme mucho el plato, a no gritar, a respetar, en fin, me han educado para vivir en una sociedad con consideraciÃ³n yÂ cortesÃ­a. En una sociedad que ahora me da la espalda y me demuestra, por mucho que intento pensar lo contrario, que todo esto no sirve para nada. Que nos dirigen con una falta total de deferencia y honradez, sin entendimiento, sin ningÃºn tipo de Ã©tica, unos dirigentes que parecen no aprendieron nada en el transcurso de su vida, sÃ³lo aÂ <em>comer con cuchara grande.</em></p>\n<br /> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=filosofiadebolsillo.wordpress.com&#038;blog=28508677&#038;post=534&#038;subd=filosofiadebolsillo&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(33,0,0,'Lo impopular de lo acadÃ©mico','text/html','http://filosofiadebolsillo.wordpress.com/2012/07/23/lo-impopular-de-lo-academico/','EducaciÃ³n;Humanidades Digitales;#RedHD;@ernestopriego;@kfitz;Humanismo',NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,4,'Aunque no soy un acadÃ©mico, ni siquiera un alumno becado, y mucho menos brillante, sÃ­ que he entonado en alguna ocasiÃ³n aquello deÂ Panem et Circenses, o en su formato mÃ¡s actual, y que tanto Ã©xito ha tenido entre los espaÃ±oles, Pan y FÃºtbol.

Y es que, echar la culpa a los demÃ¡s es el deporte preferido de las personas. AsÃ­ nos lanzamos los menos preparados, los mÃ¡s, los del medio, y todos, por separado y juntos, a entonar elÂ <em>Panem et Circenses</em>, pero a los demÃ¡s, y con una consecuencia (de ser consecuente) cero. De tal manera que despuÃ©s saltamos todos de alegrÃ­a con el fÃºtbol, con las coches o con las motos; cuando antesÂ seÃ±alÃ¡bamosÂ con el dedo a los demÃ¡s ciudadanos de segunda que seguÃ­an pidiendoÂ <em>Panem et Circenses,Â </em>y es que esto se pedÃ­a, se exigÃ­a, a los gobernantes, para divertirse. Es ahora cuando nos lo dan sin que lo pidamos. Pero esto es otro tema. A lo que iba, seÃ±alamos a los otros, aquellos que piden pan y diversiÃ³n, y Â los tratamos poco menos que deÂ <em>pocoÂ </em><em>listos</em>, cuando continuamos haciendo exactamente lo mismo, sin cambiar nada. Y ahÃ­ estamos todosÂ seÃ±alÃ¡ndonos, los unos a los otros,Â <em>pocoÂ </em><em>listos,</em>Â y saltando juntos por los deportes. AsÃ­ que no nos miramos el ombligo y entramos en un cÃ­rculo del queÂ difÃ­cilmenteÂ salimos.

Y de Â lo poco aceptados que estÃ¡n socialmente. Y de lo incomprendidos que estÃ¡n. Y de lo impopulares que son. Y la culpa, como en el caso del <em>pan y fÃºtbol</em>, es de los demÃ¡s, del pÃºblico que no comprende lo que decimos. En definitiva, y cito,<em> hasta quÃ© grado nos sentimos faltos de popularidad como acadÃ©micos, produciendo apasionadamente un trabajo que nadie parece apreciar</em>. Esto crea un sentimiento de diferencia, de exclusiÃ³n, que ademÃ¡s es bidireccional, puesto que los no acadÃ©micos ni se atreven a acercarse a su trabajo. Â El artÃ­culo que enlazo se cuestiona por los motivos de la poca aceptaciÃ³n de los temas de los que hablan los <strong>acadÃ©micos</strong>, si es que hay un culpable para esto, y propone el reto de hacer el esfuerzo para que esos temas sean seleccionados por el auditorio y, a su vez, que sean interesantes para el mercado y el capital, a la postre, culpables del desaguisado, o quizÃ¡s no, y exige para ellos mismos un esfuerzo por hacerse comprender.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Sugiere un giro por parte de los acadÃ©micos para conseguir esa aceptaciÃ³n, digamos, de masas, guardando para sÃ­, ocultando quizÃ¡s, un reducto donde poder compartir sus interioridades. Propone un cambio, una apertura, para que puedan ser mÃ¡s atractivos, quitando, sobretodo, la culpa al ciudadano que no consume su <em>trabajo.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Esto mismo se puede aplicar a cualquier disciplina, a la vuestra seguro que tambiÃ©n.

Voy a intentar aclarar un poco los tÃ©rminos, pero existen discusiones entre los expertos universitarios de los principales centros de investigaciÃ³n de esta materia, y yo no pertenezco a ninguno de ellos. AsÃ­ que lo que voy a sugerir es, con la mejor intenciÃ³n, sÃ³lo una aproximaciÃ³n.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Voy a tratar de responder a la segunda y voy a tratar de hacer una pequeÃ±a prÃ¡ctica con una aplicaciÃ³n donde se vea el resultado. Con el resultado de este ejercicio y su explicaciÃ³n, y tras una pequeÃ±a reflexiÃ³n por vuestra parte, espero que la primera pregunta quede, cuanto menos, parcialmente resuelta. En el post anterior puse un enlace del resultado de un trabajo de investigaciÃ³n realizado por un grupo de trabajo de una Universidad de Canada. El proyecto titulaba <em><a title=\"Cultureplez\" href=\"http://cultureplex.ca/projects/\" target=\"_blank\">Complejidad Cultural y Humanidades digitales</a>, </em>y dentro del mismo podÃ©is encontrar<em><a title=\"Hispanic Baroque\" href=\"http://cultureplex.ca/projects/the-hispanic-baroque/\" target=\"_blank\">Â \"The Hispanic Baroque: Complexity in the first Atlantic culture\"</a></em>, que me sirve muy bien para mostrar que esÂ <em>humanismo digital</em> y quien puede ser elÂ <em>humanista digital.</em>Â El resultado de una investigaciÃ³n sobre datos y su publicaciÃ³n, en este caso en una <em><a title=\"Hispanic Baroque\" href=\"http://www.hispanicbaroque.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">web</a>,Â </em>es el proyecto de humanidades digitales<em>Â y</em>,Â obviamente, todos aquellos que de alguna manera han participado en el proyecto son los <em>humanistas digitales. </em>Â No es mi intenciÃ³n con la inclusiÃ³n de los enlaces mÃ¡s que la de presentar un ejemplo, no tengo absolutamente ninguna relaciÃ³n con ellos, no obstante entiendo que puede ser un poco complicado, por eso he proyectado un pequeÃ±o ejercicio donde poder exponer un resultado mucho mÃ¡s simple como respuesta.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><em></em>Igual que comentaba <a title=\"Mar Cabra\" href=\"https://twitter.com/cabralens\" target=\"_blank\">@cabralens</a>Â que unÂ <em>profesional que recoge y analiza gran cantidad de informaciÃ³n y despuÃ©s la hace comprensible a travÃ©s de artÃ­culos u otras aplicaciones </em>podÃ­a identificarse con un <em>periodista de datos</em>, cualquier profesional que intervenga en un proyecto de <em>humanismo digitalÂ </em>serÃ­a equiparado con un <em>humanista digital.Â </em>Como ya comentÃ©, y como verÃ©is en el ejemplo, un <em>investigadorÂ </em>de este tipo no trabaja nunca sÃ³lo y necesita de expertos en otros campos, tÃ©cnicos informÃ¡ticos, programadores, lingÃ¼istasÂ y otros dependiendo del tipo de proyecto.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Para el ejercicio he tomado una hashtag <a title=\"#datajournalism\" href=\"https://twitter.com//search/%23datajournalism\" target=\"_blank\">#DataJournalism</a> ya que en el aparecen algunos de los protagonistas del primer post como <a title=\"Mar Cabra\" href=\"https://twitter.com/cabralens\" target=\"_blank\">@cabralens</a>,Â Â <a title=\"Media140cat\" href=\"https://twitter.com/media140cat\" target=\"_blank\">@media140cat</a>Â yÂ <a title=\"Karma PeirÃ³\" href=\"https://twitter.com/kpeiro\" target=\"_blank\">@kpeiro</a>Â con su interesante <a title=\"KarmaPeiro Bloc\" href=\"http://karmapeiro.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bloc</a>Â sobre <em>periodismo digital</em>. A partir de un API <em>(vista en las Conferencias de Digital Humanities 2012 #dh2012)</em> donde se introduce el hashtag y se activan una serie de filtros se puede obtener una nube de datos con los principales protagonistas de twitter que han usado el hashtag en cuestiÃ³n y su relaciÃ³n, si la hay, entre ellos. Clicando sobre cada uno de los actores tendrÃ©is, automÃ¡ticamente, el resultado de la interacciÃ³n del mismo con el hashtag, si ha escrito tweet, si le han respondido o si tiene una menciÃ³n. En la parte izquierda podÃ©is ver Â tres campos de selecciÃ³n,Â <em>top tweeters, top hashtagsÂ </em>yÂ <em>top conversationalist.Â </em>Donde se pueden ver los usuarios mÃ¡s activos con ese hashtag u otros hashtags usados por usuarios que usan <em>#datajouranlism.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Clicando sobre el hastagÂ <em><strong><a title=\"AplicaciÃ³n\" href=\"http://hawksey.info/tagsexplorer/?key=0At-B6fTIYNT8dGo3UkRkVnl2bkNhcFYxaUJ2UXo3dGc&amp;sheet=oaw\" target=\"_blank\">#DataJournalism</a></strong></em>Â verÃ©is el resultado de que os hablo. Y si buscÃ¡is podrÃ©is encontrar vuestras entradas (hablo de @cabralens, @kpeiro y @media140cat, por ejemplo).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Esto, claro estÃ¡, es sÃ³lo un ejemplo con el que seguro que os podÃ©is hacer una idea de las muchas aplicaciones que tiene este tipo de proyectos, tanto para <em>periodismo de datos</em> como para <em>humanidades digitales.Â </em>Y, espero, haber clarificado un poco,por lo menos como una ligera idea, lo que son las <em>Humanidades Digitales</em>, aunque seguirÃ© publicando al respecto. Estos datos pueden serÂ incluidosÂ en un estudio conjuntamente con otros. El hashtag puede ser sobre filosofÃ­a o historia y los datos formar parte de un proyecto todavÃ­a mayor, en fin, las aplicaciones se hacen infinitas.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong><em>Nota:</em></strong> El resultado de la nube variarÃ¡ ya que existe una diferencia temporal entre la generaciÃ³n de la misma y la redacciÃ³n del post y su posteo y lectura por parte vuestra.

If science is the application of rigorous methods to hypothesis testing, then is this a situation wherein computer scientists &amp;amp; engineers aren&apos;t practicing much <em>science</em> at all?    <p id=\"blogfeeds\"><$BlogFeedsVertical$></p> <img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5451402265095963256-804979288132836047?l=libraryanalytics.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; /><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LibrariesAndAnalytics/~4/yPywsuURf2Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(59,0,0,'#LAK12 Semantic Web: Glimpses of Understanding','text/html','http://libraryanalytics.blogspot.com/2012/02/lak12-spinning-in-semantic-web.html',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-02-19 09:10:18',5,'What I understand about the semantic web is that it: -- relies on metadata that codes the metaphysical identity of a piece of data and how it relates to other things or concepts.

This would be akin to a Walmart-like situation wherein when a customer buys a stock item with a certain SKU, stock levels of that SKU are checked and compared with rate at which that SKU has been purchased that week and average time to reship from vendor, then depending on those results, an automatic order is sent to the vendor. I think this is what LA aspires to. For example, student doesn&apos;t log in to the CMS for a certain number of days and depending on their demographics or the time of the semester, student services or the course instructor sends out an exploratory, \"Hey, how&apos;s it going? How can we help?\" email, which is most likely automated as well.<br /><br />Note that illustration #4 offered above tend to be more \"academic analytics\" use, which I interpret as more institution-based, i.e. how can we run this institution more efficiently? Illustrations #1 and 5 are more \"learning analytics\" focused, which I interpret as learner-based, i.e. How can we help an individual or class of individuals succeed academically?<br /><br /><br />The article further mentions that central research administration is one of the organizational units least likely to use analytics, which is rather telling. Here&apos;s a possible use: strengths of association between academic departments or individual research faculty are analyzed through bibliographic citation data, or in subject tags for their publications (like MeSH headings, for those of you who use PubMed). Individuals who are found to be highly associated in terms of the domains in which they work could be potential collaborators, joint/bulk purchasers, etc. It would be especially valuable for larger institutions which are spread out geographically, and for central research administration which sometimes are not aware of these types of links. Cost savings would be realized, and the \"team science\" concept could be implemented. I&apos;m sure this is one of the purposes of systems such as <a href=\"http://profiles.catalyst.harvard.edu/\">Harvard Profiles </a>and <a href=\"http://www.vivoweb.org/\">VIVO</a>, which allow visualization of connections between researcher and departments. <p id=\"blogfeeds\"><$BlogFeedsVertical$></p> <img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5451402265095963256-6546050608376112130?l=libraryanalytics.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; /><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LibrariesAndAnalytics/~4/fR-cLDJOS6c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>',1347890414,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Mon, 30 Jan 2012 18:54:00 +0000',NULL,'Libraries and  Analytics',NULL,'<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk/4459859196/\"><img id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5703535713209800338\" style=\"FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; WIDTH: 240px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 160px\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-loW5WHBWcBM/TycHgzWf1pI/AAAAAAAAAB0/JqL2l-au6oQ/s320/4459859196_c83b122710_m.jpg\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><br /><br />Goldstein&apos;s <a href=\"http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ecar_so/ers/ers0508/EKF0508.pdf\"><em>Academic Analytics: The Uses of Management Information and Technology in Higher Education </em>(2005)</a> mentions \"five levels of sophistication of use\" of academic analytics. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />1) transaction only: i.e. \"How many students logged in to Course Y in the last 24 hours?\" You would run a query on the learning management system but it would only happen on command.<br /><br />2) \"analysis and monitoring of operational performance\": An illustration of might be: \"What is the trend in Mediasite (lecture capture) usage throughout the semester?\" This specific question is especially appropriate if your resource is limited to a certain number of concurrent users, for example.

This would be akin to a Walmart-like situation wherein when a customer buys a stock item with a certain SKU, stock levels of that SKU are checked and compared with rate at which that SKU has been purchased that week and average time to reship from vendor, then depending on those results, an automatic order is sent to the vendor. I think this is what LA aspires to. For example, student doesn&apos;t log in to the CMS for a certain number of days and depending on their demographics or the time of the semester, student services or the course instructor sends out an exploratory, \"Hey, how&apos;s it going? How can we help?\" email, which is most likely automated as well.<br /><br />Note that illustration #4 offered above tend to be more \"academic analytics\" use, which I interpret as more institution-based, i.e. how can we run this institution more efficiently? Illustrations #1 and 5 are more \"learning analytics\" focused, which I interpret as learner-based, i.e. How can we help an individual or class of individuals succeed academically?<br /><br /><br />The article further mentions that central research administration is one of the organizational units least likely to use analytics, which is rather telling. Here&apos;s a possible use: strengths of association between academic departments or individual research faculty are analyzed through bibliographic citation data, or in subject tags for their publications (like MeSH headings, for those of you who use PubMed). Individuals who are found to be highly associated in terms of the domains in which they work could be potential collaborators, joint/bulk purchasers, etc. It would be especially valuable for larger institutions which are spread out geographically, and for central research administration which sometimes are not aware of these types of links. Cost savings would be realized, and the \"team science\" concept could be implemented. I&apos;m sure this is one of the purposes of systems such as <a href=\"http://profiles.catalyst.harvard.edu/\">Harvard Profiles </a>and <a href=\"http://www.vivoweb.org/\">VIVO</a>, which allow visualization of connections between researcher and departments. <p id=\"blogfeeds\"><$BlogFeedsVertical$></p> <img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5451402265095963256-6546050608376112130?l=libraryanalytics.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; /><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LibrariesAndAnalytics/~4/fR-cLDJOS6c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(69,0,0,'#LAK12 Google vs. your English 101 instructor','text/html','http://libraryanalytics.blogspot.com/2012/01/lak12-google-vs-your-english-101.html','learning analytics criticisms',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-02-20 11:44:47',5,'LA is fundamentally ethically different from the analysis done by online vendors because of power differentials.

This reading helped to explain why I had felt unable to get a clear sense of what was meant by OERs. The concept seems to be vague and broad, including not just the &#8216;learning objects&#8217; I had most closely associated with the term but also the museum and library based <a href=\"http://rustleblog.wordpress.com/2012/06/28\">digital resources</a> like the ones colleagues have been working on and even software like Moodle and things like licenses. To say, as the authors do that &#8216;The definition of \"open educational resources\" needs further refinement&#8217; seems something of an understatement!</p>\n<p>Although much of the technical detail about systems is beyond me (and/or of little interest to me) it is clear that even an &#8216;OER&#8217; like Moodle can be used to create learning resources that are not open because they are within the &#8216;walled garden&#8217; of Â a VLE that is restricted to people formally subscribed to a particular course. I was a little surprised, however, that by some definitions (Downes 2006) the MOOC we are engaged in could not be called &#8216;open&#8217; because it required registration and login. I accept that these are barriers of a sort, but I think they are the least of the challenges that might limit participation which may be more around accessibility, digital literacy/skills and time resources. The reading goes on to discuss this &#8216;social before concluding that Â &#8217;the Mako Hill and MÃ¶ller definition of freedom goes beyond all the levels of openness described by Tuomi (2006) and would view most existing OER as not free. The OECD Secretariat therefore adheres to Tuomi&apos;s definition of openness&#8217; (page 35-36).</p>\n<p>One aspect of the definition of OER that particularly interested me but which received little discussion by the OECD (for perfectly understandable and practical reasons) was the question of whether we should speak of educational or learning resources. These are related but distinct concepts which are very close to my practice as an <strong>education</strong> developer in a teaching (there&#8217;s another one) and <strong>learning</strong> Â development unit. Education seems to line up on the teaching side of the apparent divide and seems to me to carry connotations of something &#8216;done to&#8217; learners by institutions and professionals, whereas learning is something that every human being (and probably other living creatures) does all the time. Some of the learning we do is unintentional, even unhelpful (what I &#8216;learn&#8217; from watching reality TV for example) but however purposeful or not, it is learning and is to a considerable degree within my control. So I would argue that what we are calling open <em>educational</em> resources should really be called<em> learning</em> resources, if they are truly open. If, however, these resources are still going to be mediated by educational institutions and teachers then are they really open?</p>\n<p>The last thing I want to say today (it&#8217;s getting late here and I am supposed to be on holiday) is in relation to the view that for OERsÂ &#8217;the value of the resource should be enlarged when used&#8217; (page 38). This assumes not just consumption or use of resources but the creation, augmentation, embellishment or development of the resource. Digital media facilitates this in a way that print media is unable to (marginalia in a library book is an example of print media being augmented for future readers but the accessibility is not good!) and I look forward to seeing how we can all enlarge the value of the OERs encountered in this MOOC.</p>\n<br /> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/annehole.wordpress.com/117/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/annehole.wordpress.com/117/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=annehole.wordpress.com&#038;blog=38332438&#038;post=117&#038;subd=annehole&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(90,76,0,'MOOCing','text/html','http://annehole.wordpress.com/2012/08/30/moocing/','Uncategorized',NULL,NULL,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,7,'This is where I will blog about the Openness in Education MOOC.

Â It&#8217;s all thanks to fabulous author and blogger Susan Cain and the dots she has connected for me with fellow authors I admire: Gretchen Rubin and BrenÃ© Brown.</p>\n<p>Borrowing from <a href=\"http://www.ordinarycourage.com/my-blog/2012/5/31/an-inspiration-interview-giveaway-with-susan-cain.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Brown&#8217;s interview with Ms. Cain</a>, I&#8217;d like to offer my own insights on vulnerability and becoming an authentic, open, outspoken introvert within the learning profession:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Vulnerability is</strong>: taking the risk to be authentic, regardless of how others may percieve me.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What role does vulnerability play in my work?</strong> Â Learning is inherently a vulnerable task. Â So is helping others to learn.</p>\n<p>Learning involves risk, failure and potential embarassment, which propel us to develop our resilience or else crumble under pressure. Â Learning in the participatory, networked age, involves more openness and sharing than ever before, which are also activities that make a person more exposed and vulnerable to criticism, punishment or attack.</p>\n<p>Introverts can be mis-labelled as &#8216;not team players&#8217; and that is very risky in a learning profession dominated by extraverts who reward and recognize outgoingness and particular flavours of group-based contribution and collaboration. Â Introversion seems to come with a moderate to serious dose of conflict avoidance, which means speaking truth to power can be very threatening, both personally and professionally.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What does authenticity mean to me and how do I practice it in my work?</strong> I&#8217;ve developed considerable confidence in my guidance and expertise over the past few years while researching practices that are quite threatening to the hierarchical status quo. Â Being authentic means speaking up about seismic shifts in social, networked learning and technology that are revolutionizing my profession. Â It also means finding authentic ways to express my professional values, opinions, passions and beliefs while still remaining employed!</p>\n<p><strong>4. Is perfectionism an issue for me? If so, what&#8217;s one of my strategies for managing it?</strong> Perfectionsim was a significant issue for me throughout my childhood and education and is still a default behaviour, though I am learning to recognize its limitations and let go more often.</p>\n<p>One of the ways that I do that is by reflecting on Gretchen Rubin&#8217;s <a href=\"http://happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2012/05/quiz-are-you-an-abstainer-or-a-moderator/\" target=\"_blank\">abstainer/moderator question</a>.Â  Perfectionism seems to be an all-or-nothing abstainer behaviour that can lead to analysis paralysis. Â I actually seek to be a moderator in most aspects of my life and work.</p>\n<p>However, I highly value excellence, timeliness, accuracy and quality so perfectionism is an easy path to take, especially when extraverts in my profession seem to champion quality and excellence without always delivering on it. Â The challenge for me now is to keep designing solutions and offering guidance that are excellent without necessarily being perfect. Â Jay Cross&#8217; <a href=\"http://www.jaycross.com/wp/tag/beta/\" target=\"_blank\">perpetual beta</a> approach fits well here, too.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What inspires me?</strong> Â Over the past few years, authenticity has really inspired me because I know first-hand how difficult it is to explore and sustain. Â I recognize authenticity immediately in others and gravitate towards it. Â Those who choose to &#8216;fake it &#8217;till you make it&#8217; tend to rub me the wrong way and I am being much more selective about whether I spend time in their company.</p>\n<p><strong>6. What&#8217;s something that gets in the way of my creativity and how do I move through it?</strong> Â I think perfectionism and formal schooling used to get in the way of my creativity. Â In school, there was a right and wrong way to do everything and less than 100% wasn&#8217;t good enough. Â I&#8217;m very analytical and detail-oriented as well, which is not really a creative mindset. Â Thankfully, we had to take an art class in teachers&#8217; college (led by our Dean, no less!) and that reminded me of how joyful it was to let go of rigid structures and processes. Â I dabble with blogging and photography from more of an instinctual place now and try to leave the style guides and how-to books on the shelf.</p>\n<p>I have also learned to seek out creativity from individuals and sources that are outside of my usual network. One example is the #ds106 mooc and <a href=\"http://tdc.ds106.us\" target=\"_blank\">The Daily Create</a> assignment. Â The contents of that site add so much richness to my thoughts and experiences, offering many ways of looking at the same concept or object. Â I am also playing around with a fun little application called Draw Something, which is a light-hearted way to get one&#8217;s point across, even with strangers.</p>\n<p><strong>7.Â What&#8217;s on my nightstand?</strong>Â Steve Jobs&#8217; biography with that captivating front cover photo andÂ <a href=\"http://www.markhaddon.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Red House</a>Â by Mark Haddon on my e-reader.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Describe a snapshot of a joyful moment in my life</strong>. I am happiest at home with my loved ones, two legs and four. Â Recent joyful moments include watching my puppy chase butterflies on the beach, swooning over crepes with one fellow black sheep, exploring introversion in the workplace with another and cheerleading authenticity while floating in a lake with a third.</p>\n<p><strong>9.

Am I an introvert or an extravert? How do other people see me?</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m definitely an introvert, and even more of one than I realized before eagerly consuming every word of Ms. Cain&#8217;s book this spring.</p>\n<p>Although I had dreamed of a particular career since I was a young child and did pursue it formally for many years, it was a very good choice for me not to stay in that role. Â I do not have the stamina required to be &#8216;on&#8217; with people all day. Â All teacher education programs would be greatly improved by having an honest discussion about introversion and extraversion before handing out their degrees!</p>\n<p>Over the past three years, I have realized how easily I become exhausted by extraverted energy so now I am choosing quite often to decline interactions with extraverts or invitations to extraverted activities, without regrets.</p>\n<p>Other people in my work environment likely see me as fairly extraverted because I am very outspoken and I address individuals and groups quite confidently when sharing the expertise that I have accumulated in recent years, particularly if I am addressing people at a distance. Â I do a lot of online coaching and desktop sharing with collaborative technology but it&#8217;s usually one-on-one now. Â I can only sustain the energy required for the group stuff once in awhile and with considerable advance preparation. Â Ms. Cain writes frequently about how introverts are not well suited to speaking extemporaneously (on our feet) and I can see that in myself, for sure.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What did I want to be when I grew up, and why?</strong></p>\n<p>From quite a young age, I wanted to be an elementary school teacher and that is what I pursued wholeheartedly through volunteer and paid work, formal training, two post-secondary degrees and considerable first-hand experience for a dozen years. Â Ultimately, I am much happier in my current learning profession, in which I work with adults. Â Admittedly, working with children seems much easier sometimes! <img src=&apos;http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif&apos; alt=&apos;:)&apos; class=&apos;wp-smiley&apos; /> </p>\n<p><strong>3. Write about someone I admire.</strong></p>\n<p>I admire my closest friends and a small number of colleagues and superiors for being &#8216;black sheep&#8217; who stand their own ground, who call a spade a shovel and who challenge the status quo in their personal lives and in their professions. Â That takes a tremendous amount of courage and resilience, which I admire and try to emulate in my own ways.</p>\n<p>My close friends and I are spending a lot of time reflecting on what makes us happy and what doesn&#8217;t, in great detail, as introverts are prone to do. Â Ms. Cain&#8217;s book has been a source of lengthy and intriguing conversation about our similarities as introverts, our fatigue from feigning extraversion and our growing realization of how the world is generally not structured for our success.</p>\n<p><strong>4. When I feel afraid, how do I embolden myself?</strong></p>\n<p>I often ask myself why I&#8217;m afraid of something. Â If I&#8217;m procrastinating about taking action, I try to go forward and conquer it using Ms. Rubin&#8217;s helpful mantra &#8220;<a href=\"http://happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2007/12/try-to-do-one-n/\" target=\"_blank\">tackle a nagging task</a>&#8220;. Â When I do so, I usually find that the anxiety I was investing in the procrastination was not worth it!</p>\n<p>I also take a look at the clock: if it&#8217;s getting close to bed time, it is *not* a good time to make a decision or take action. Â  Go to sleep and figure out if the issue still has as much weight in the light of a new day.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Quirky or mainstream &#8211; which adjective suits me better, and why?</strong></p>\n<p>Rather quirky and proud of it! Â And I find myself caring less and less what others think these days. Â As Eleanor Roosevelt wisely said, &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t worry so much about what others think of you if you realized how seldom they do.&#8221; Â And this gem: &#8220;What other people think of me is none of my business.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In a tech-loaded world where image is supposedly important and &#8216;fame&#8217; is instantaneous and fleeting, I put a lot of effort into identifying and sticking to my priorities, regardless of whether others know about them or agree with them.</p>\n<p><strong>6. What is my absolute favorite way of spending time (other than with my family)?</strong></p>\n<p>Swimming in fresh water, if I&#8217;m lucky, or travelling to locations with salted water, if I&#8217;m even luckier. Â Water is calming and cleansing to me in ways that almost defy words. Â I spent 18 decadent days at various beaches this summer and loved every minute of it!</p>\n<p><strong>7. Gandhi said: &#8220;In a gentle way, you can shake the world.&#8221; If I could shake the world gently, what would my own signature contribution be? (Please don&#8217;t feel the need to say something like &#8220;End world hunger&#8221; or &#8220;Create lasting peace.&#8221;)</strong></p>\n<p>My pet peeve right now is distracted driving with cell phones, which has become illegal in many places. Â To everyone out there who thinks it&#8217;s okay to text or talk on the phone while driving: I see you in my rearview mirror everyday. Â You are really not 1/10th as important as you think you are and most of what you think is &#8216;urgent&#8217; is not so put the damn phone away and keep the rest of us safe!</p>\n<p>Hey, I wonder if most of the guilty parties are extraverts? Â Now, that would be an interesting study!</p>\n<p>If any readers would like to explore one or more of the above questions, I would be delighted to read your responses. Â Thanks for spending some time with mine.</p>\n<br /> Tagged: <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/change-2/&apos;>change</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/happiness/&apos;>happiness</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/introversion/&apos;>introversion</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/time/&apos;>time</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/717/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/717/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com&#038;blog=27959777&#038;post=717&#038;subd=brainysmurf1234&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(93,18,0,'What &#8216;open&#8217; means to me','text/html','http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/what-open-means-to-me/','Smarter worker;#oped12;#open',NULL,NULL,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,8,'As I start into the new #oped12 mooc this week, it seems fitting to reflect on what #open means to me.

#cck12, #ds106 and #fslt12.Â  It&apos;s hard to believe that I have been mooc-free and blogless for nearly three months.Â  With all of theÂ sunny summer weather we&apos;ve been having since May, I&apos;ve been spending as much time as possible at the beach.Â  And, truth be told, I haven&apos;t regretted spending more time offline than online lately.</p>\n<p>As I dipped my toes back into the serendipitous pool of social media this month, IÂ read some of <a href=\"http://cpsrenewal.ca/\">Nick Charney&apos;s posts</a>, including his rationale for blogging weekly.Â  He wrote about needing time to digest, rewrite, revisit and synthesize.Â  In the same spirit, I would like to share some reflections that I have been pondering for the past five yearsÂ while learning to &apos;manage&apos;:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">* email</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">* information</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">* networks</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">* personal knowledge</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">* projects</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">* time</p>\n<p>I am also sitting a little taller in my chair because of this statement about conscious computing and partial attention:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Â <em>\"We have focused on managing our time. Our opportunity is to focus on how we manage our attention.\"</em> â€“ <a href=\"http://lindastone.net/qa/continuous-partial-attention/\">Linda Stone</a></p>\n<p>Thank you, Linda!Â  This strikes me as a good starting pointÂ for whatÂ I&apos;ve wanted to ask Jane Hart for awhile: \"<a href=\"http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/blog/2012/07/15/how-can-i-convince-others-about-the-power-of-social-in-an-organisation/\">How can I convince others about the value of social technologies in an organization?</a>\"Â </p>\n<p>I feel confident in saying that social technologies have given me more effective ways to use my time (see Harold Jarche on <a href=\"http://www.jarche.com/2012/07/reducing-email/\">reducing email</a>) and have helped me to focus my attention</p>\n<p><strong><em>BUT&#8230;</em></strong></p>\n<p>I had to figure out how to makeÂ <a href=\"http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/2012/02/04/how-i-make-time-for-social-networked-learning/\">the best use of certain social technologies</a>, through considerable time and practice, before they paid off any returns.Â  I also had to modify or dump the ones that weren&#8217;t working for me.Â </p>\n<p>Last year, for example, I invested several weeks of regular use on Twitter (with guidance from generousÂ #change11 moocers on FaceBook) in order to decode the nature of hashtags, tiny URLs and acronyms that allow us to stretch considerable meaning across 140 characters.Â Â  After figuring out the balance of noise and useful nuggets that Twitter can add to myÂ information flow,Â I now only make time to pan its streams occasionally.</p>\n<p>And this is where I hit a massive roadblock with most of the people at my workplace: the \"I don&apos;t have time\" mantra, often coupled with the chant \"I&apos;m not very good with technology\".Â  Insert sound of head rolling across keyboard.Â  Repeatedly.</p>\n<p>I&apos;m calling shenanigans on those excuses.Â  Do they think my knowledge and skills with technology fell from the sky?Â  We all have time in our work days (a mandatedÂ 8 hours or similar).Â  The question is: how do we choose to spend our time?</p>\n<p>Uh, oh.Â  There I go bringing up choices again.Â  To which the tokenÂ response is \"&#8230;but I&apos;m so busy!Â  There are so many priorities! I don&apos;t choose how to spend my time.\"Â </p>\n<p>That is bullsh*t.Â Â  Poor-me-I&#8217;m-a-time-victim-bullsh*t.</p>\n<p>I&apos;m talking about adults, <strong><em>well-paid learning professionals, executivesÂ and knowledge workers</em></strong>, who make choices every hour about:</p>\n<p>* how many emails and texts to look at</p>\n<p>* how many disruptions from people and technology that they&apos;re willing to tolerate</p>\n<p>* how many meeting invitations they accept and then complain about</p>\n<p>* how many collectively-bargained lunch hours and breaks they voluntarily give up</p>\n<p>* how many fictitious deadlines they&#8217;ll work towards without negotiating a more reasonable timeline</p>\n<p>* how many e-boring courses they develop</p>\n<p>* how many deaths-by-bullet-point they create</p>\n<p>* how much chronic overtime they are willing to work in their cubicles, on the road or at home</p>\n<p>* how many times they&#8217;ll cover for someone else who is away and don&apos;t get their own work done</p>\n<p>* how much time they (don&apos;t) spend learning something that will make work easier</p>\n<p>At the moment, we don&apos;t have much control over the reality that email is one of our biggest streams of information at work.Â Â That&apos;s not likely to change anytime soon given the resistance embedded in the poorÂ work habits that I&#8217;ve listed above.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, I recognized a long time ago that I have to manage email very diligently so that I can stay on top of what&apos;s happening.Â  Email management takes commitment, patience, attention to details and focus.Â  I believe that chronic mis-management of email is at the heart of most backlogs to productivity, even in the second decade of the 21st century.</p>\n<p>Say I&apos;ve sent a recipient three emails over the past two work days regarding projects x, y and z.Â  This is good practice: I use one discrete subject per email that makes it easier to categorize, prioritizeÂ and search for the item later, if necessary.</p>\n<p>The recipient (likely equal rank to me or paid an extra decimal place more than I am) might have skimmed through all three emails but can&apos;t find the email about y anymore so asks me to send it again.Â  Why can&apos;tÂ he or she find the originalÂ email?Â  It&apos;s part of an account with thousands of emails, hundreds of folders, links, attachments, &apos;read later&apos; piles and archives.Â  If the recipient is a bit more tech-savvy, that junk drawer is also cluttered with newsletters and RSS feeds and notifications and social media updates.</p>\n<p>It&apos;s madness.</p>\n<p>No wonder they can&apos;t focus.Â </p>\n<p>No wonder my work gets backlogged by people who don&apos;t know which response I am waiting for because my email doesn&apos;t stand out from the rest of the noise they&apos;ve invited into their accounts.Â  And then it falls upon me, originator of the well-articulated request, to keep track of their lack of response and resend the item in some fashion that might get their attention.Â  How tiresome.</p>\n<p>Reality check: no one is going to come along and give us less email, less information or less work to do.Â  Very few managers are willing to say, \"Take some time away from what you were doing and get organized so that you can focus.\"Â  We have to make that time for ourselves and treat it as real, honest-to-goodness work that is as important as anything else we do all day because it keeps us in check with what&apos;s hot, what&apos;s not, what&apos;s on fire and what&apos;s been laid to rest.Â  <em><strong>Update</strong></em>: here are some <a href=\"http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/2012/08/16/tools-for-taming-the-email-beast/\">tools and habits</a> to help you get started.</p>\n<p>I get the distinct feeling that I am part of a very tiny minority of people who are not stressed out by my own email and, consequently, not as stressed about my workload, my time or the status of my contribution to collaborative projects.Â Â So, to borrow from Jane&apos;s lovely question, how do I convince others that using social technologies to manage email more effectively will give them back the very time in the day that they claim to be missing?Â  Wouldn&apos;t that message just get lost in their clutter?</p>\n<br /> Tagged: <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/clutter/&apos;>clutter</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/email/&apos;>email</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/filtering/&apos;>filtering</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/management/&apos;>management</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/networks/&apos;>networks</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/social-media/&apos;>social media</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/technology/&apos;>technology</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/time/&apos;>time</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/626/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/626/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com&#038;blog=27959777&#038;post=626&#038;subd=brainysmurf1234&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(99,1,0,'A gold star for connecting','text/html','http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/2012/05/17/a-gold-star-for-connecting/','Smarter worker',NULL,NULL,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,8,'To my fellow moocies and moderatorsÂ in #change11, #ds106, #cck12 and now #fslt12, I offer you a gold star for making time to connect, to share, to risk and to explore.

Estos espacios tradicionales ahora podÃ­an ser trasladados, situaciÃ³n que sÃ³lo habÃ­an aprovechado la EducaciÃ³n a Distancia por correspondencia o a travÃ©s de la televisiÃ³n.</p>\n<p>Estos centros llevaron nombres como, <strong>Centro de EducaciÃ³n a Distancia,</strong> Centros de TecnologÃ­a Educativa, <strong>Centros de TecnologÃ­a Aplicada a la EducaciÃ³n</strong>, Centro Educacional de Alta TecnologÃ­a, Centro de EducaciÃ³n Asistida por las Nuevas TecnologÃ­as de la InformaciÃ³n y ComunicaciÃ³n.</p>\n<p>En estos tiempos en dÃ³nde la Web 2.0 ya es una realidad, cuando no solo somos consumidores sino productores de informacion, y cuÃ¡ndo las redes sociales nos permiten comunicarnos con quienes comparten intereses y Ã¡reas de conocimiento, sin protocolos previos de inscripciÃ³n, incorporaciÃ³n, todas las palabras utilizadas anteriormente se antojan anacrÃ³nicas.</p>\n<p>Ahora no es educaciÃ³n, es aprendizaje, ahora no es a distancia es en red, ahora no es en espacios Ãºnicos sino en aquÃ©llos en los que se encuentran nuestros &#8220;ambientes personales de aprendizaje&#8221;, ahora no es en ciclos educativos, ahora es a lo largo de la vida.</p>\n<p>Me congratulo enormemente con el ITESO por este <strong>Centro de Aprendizaje en Red</strong>, nombre testimonio de la comprensiÃ³n de las nuevas formas que estÃ¡n surgiendo alrededor de los fenÃ³menos comunicativos propios de la enseÃ±anza-aprendizaje, educaciÃ³n, comunicaciÃ³n, conexiÃ³n.</p>\n<br /> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/claudiaguerreros.wordpress.com/229/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/claudiaguerreros.wordpress.com/229/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=claudiaguerreros.wordpress.com&#038;blog=19275578&#038;post=229&#038;subd=claudiaguerreros&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(105,0,0,'Cambio de hÃ¡bitos, costumbres, cotidianeidad','text/html','http://claudiaguerreros.wordpress.com/2012/08/21/cambio-de-habitos-costumbres-cotidianeidad/','explorArTIC',NULL,NULL,5,NULL,NULL,NULL,10,'El hombre es un animal de costumbres, dice Mafalda quiÃ©n ademÃ¡s completa la fraseÂ  diciendo que mÃ¡s bien de costumbre &#8230;<p><a href=\"http://claudiaguerreros.wordpress.com/2012/08/21/cambio-de-habitos-costumbres-cotidianeidad/\">Continuar leyendo &#187;</a></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=claudiaguerreros.wordpress.com&#038;blog=19275578&#038;post=213&#038;subd=claudiaguerreros&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',1347891004,NULL,NULL,'claudiaguerreros','http://claudiaguerreros.wordpress.com','Tue, 21 Aug 2012 22:12:03 +0000',NULL,'De acÃ¡ y de allÃ¡',NULL,'<p>El hombre es un animal de costumbres, dice Mafalda quiÃ©n ademÃ¡s completa la fraseÂ  diciendo que mÃ¡s bien de costumbre el hombre es un animal.</p>\n<p>En el documento <a href=\"https://personal.crocodoc.com/pOYs0KG\">Conociendo el Conocimiento</a>Â  George Siemens dice que ahora mÃ¡s que nunca los individuos tienen control, capacidad de crear y conectarse que en cualquier otra Ã©poca.</p>\n<p>Ahora podemos conocernos a travÃ©s de un mundo virtual, lo que nos coloca delante de otra forma de comunicaciÃ³n en la que no contamos con los auxilios visuales del lenguaje corporal o la tonalidad de la voz.</p>\n<p>Finalmente la educaciÃ³n formal preparaba al individuo para una larga carrera, en un campo concreto, y a Ã©sta se le asociaba la seguridad del empleo y la rutina de vida.

QuizÃ¡s se requiera de toda una forma revolucionaria de concebir el conocimiento.</p>\n<p>Leyendo a Siemmens pareciera que dentro de las influencias histÃ³ricas que padecemos se encuentra la clasificaciÃ³n y en sus palabras dice</p>\n<p style=\"font-style:normal;line-height:21px;\"><em>&#8220;reduce la carga cognitiva pero resulta ser una rÃ©mora cuando no refleja con precisiÃ³n el NUCLEO SUBYACENTE.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>y tambiÃ©n enfoca su pensamiento hacia la <strong>forma lineal</strong> de escribir a la que califica de una <strong>tarea exigente</strong>.</p>\n<p>Es quizÃ¡s que la tecnologÃ­a anterior (pergamino, tinta, papel) nos obligaba a la escritura y lectura lineal y que esta sea la forma antinatural a la que nos hemos acostumbrado, cuando en realidad pensamos en forma de retÃ­culas o de lo que es conocido como rizoma y que <strong>lo natural sea el hipertexto</strong>, que de pronto se nos antoja caÃ³tico pero que nos va enlazando a lugares caprichosos y no determinados por la fuente Ãºnica del libro, profesor.</p>\n<p>Dice ademÃ¡s que el anterior modelo de comunicaciÃ³n es unidireccional, jerÃ¡rquico, creado por unos e impuesto a la mayorÃ­a: cuando los periÃ³dicos publican y nosotros leemos, cuando el radio cuenta las noticias y nosotros las escuchamos, cuando el profesor enseÃ±a y los alumnos aprenden.</p>\n<p>En las redes la comunicaciÃ³n se adapta, y crea una estructura deÂ acuerdo a intereses y necesidades con herramientas que el mismo usuarioÂ controla como blogs, trending topics e interacciÃ³n aÃºn y con la fuente original.</p>\n<p>El reto nos alcanza a todos por igual, el cambio de costumbres es para todos, periodistas, comunicadores, lectores, audiencias, profesores, alumnos.Â Si quienes estÃ¡n a cargo no participan del cambio, mÃ¡s difÃ­cil es hacerlos creer que realmente algo estÃ¡ sucediendo.</p>\n<br /> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/claudiaguerreros.wordpress.com/177/\"><img

Our interest is K-12 open learning - although there are things to learn from the university view too; should we have a K-12 learning strand, or even an extra week at the end for this sig?\"<br /><br />- <b>BUT</b> do not want to upset what must have been an extensive planning and preparation set up.<br /><br />Has anyone on #oped12 who is interested in Open Learning and, in particular, K-12 Open Learning, got any ideas how we might complement this excellent opportunity to discuss Openness in Education?<br /><br />Please comment below or use #opedK12 on Twitter.&amp;nbsp; <br /><br /><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td valign=\"top\" width=\"100\"><b>Week</b></td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"400\"><b>Activity</b></td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\" width=\"92\">1</td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"269\">Course Introductions<br /><b>Module 1 â€“ Defining openness</b><br />- History of openness in higher education <br />- Types of openness: content, teaching, scholarship</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\" width=\"92\">2</td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"269\"><b>Module 1 â€“ Defining openness</b><br />- Current definitions and trends in openness</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\" width=\"92\">3</td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"269\"><b>Module 2 â€“ Licenses and content protection</b><br />- History of copyright <br /><i>(Paper #1 due)</i></td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\" width=\"92\">4</td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"269\"><b>Module 2 â€“ Licenses and content protection</b><br />- Alternative licensing systems <br />- Open source/Linux models <br />- Creative Commons <br />- Current copyright/content protection initiatives&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(ACTA) </td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\" width=\"92\">5</td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"269\"><b>Module&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3</b><b>&amp;nbsp;â€“Models for developing open resources</b><br />-&amp;nbsp;Crowdsource?

It NEEDS a total re-think and this is a good reminder of the ways that it can be done. <br />#change11<img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5256199820880743341-3854155912047227320?l=edtech-insights.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(126,1,0,'Framework for Flipping','text/html','http://edtech-insights.blogspot.com/2012/05/framework-for-flipping.html','Learning and Teaching',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-05-07 11:32:16',11,'Flipped classes have been around for some time (2001 is the earliest that I can find references to).

I used the idea of an autonomous learner and the idea of \"advanced systematised knowing\", allowing learners to interact, to synthesise through dialogue and the environment, and thus to produce an act of knowing with a slightly more systematised level of knowing in the autonomous learners.<br /><br />Here is the final diagram again from the original Freire (please note, it contains a bit I added on regarding the environment - this seemed to me to be essential to explain what actually happens):<br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rnWYfiyKvZ0/T5ceJoIaT4I/AAAAAAABAbo/DBfTQhD1OiE/s1600/Freire.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"451\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rnWYfiyKvZ0/T5ceJoIaT4I/AAAAAAABAbo/DBfTQhD1OiE/s640/Freire.PNG\" width=\"640\" /></a><br /><br />So, the Educator with her maximised systematised knowing, through dialogue, achieved an \"act of knowing\" thus systematising the Learner&apos;s knowing a little more.<br />&amp;nbsp; <br />Can we replace the Educator with her textbook? Her digital resources? I think we can. In this way, the Learner can receive a non-face-to-face act of knowing and systematise her/his knowing a little more. But I would add that the outcome of this process is not predetermined, nor qualitatively predetermined.<br />The more systematised the knowing is in the learner the more likely that there will be understanding of the textbook/digital resource. The more autonomous the learner (in terms motivation, attitude and drive), the more likely that there will be a synthesis or an interaction with the environment and hence learning occur.<br />Could this mean that the learner&apos;s age will be a factor here? As might be the learner&apos;s stage of systematisation of knowing? Is it a necessary requirement for an Educator to be directly present face-to-face in these cases?

I used the idea of an autonomous learner and the idea of \"advanced systematised knowing\", allowing learners to interact, to synthesise through dialogue and the environment, and thus to produce an act of knowing with a slightly more systematised level of knowing in the autonomous learners.<br /><br />Here is the final diagram again from the original Freire (please note, it contains a bit I added on regarding the environment - this seemed to me to be essential to explain what actually happens):<br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rnWYfiyKvZ0/T5ceJoIaT4I/AAAAAAABAbo/DBfTQhD1OiE/s1600/Freire.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"451\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rnWYfiyKvZ0/T5ceJoIaT4I/AAAAAAABAbo/DBfTQhD1OiE/s640/Freire.PNG\" width=\"640\" /></a><br /><br />So, the Educator with her maximised systematised knowing, through dialogue, achieved an \"act of knowing\" thus systematising the Learner&apos;s knowing a little more.<br />&amp;nbsp; <br />Can we replace the Educator with her textbook? Her digital resources? I think we can. In this way, the Learner can receive a non-face-to-face act of knowing and systematise her/his knowing a little more. But I would add that the outcome of this process is not predetermined, nor qualitatively predetermined.<br />The more systematised the knowing is in the learner the more likely that there will be understanding of the textbook/digital resource. The more autonomous the learner (in terms motivation, attitude and drive), the more likely that there will be a synthesis or an interaction with the environment and hence learning occur.<br />Could this mean that the learner&apos;s age will be a factor here? As might be the learner&apos;s stage of systematisation of knowing? Is it a necessary requirement for an Educator to be directly present face-to-face in these cases?

Now, not sure I understand what this last statement means, but he uses this as the justification for moving away from content to skills.<br />The video is pertinent to this discussion from about 16:00 onwards and in it he says of a Microsoft global research survey:<br /><i>\"...if innovative teaching practices are connected without technology you get great experience with no scale; technology applied without great teaching, you get very little change...; great innovative teaching with great technology you get scale and change and lasting impact\".</i><br />Would like to see the research on this, although it seems logical.<br /><br /><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/EG6PVCMb3tE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5256199820880743341-6203381333953555441?l=edtech-insights.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(133,1,0,'Andy Hargreaves setting the scene at ECIS Vienna Leadership Conference','text/html','http://edtech-insights.blogspot.com/2012/04/andy-hargreaves-setting-scene-at-ecis.html','Learning and Teaching',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-04-13 05:30:26',11,'With the overall theme of \"Forming the Future\" the ECIS Leadership conference gets underway in Vienna.

It led me to reading blogs. I liked reading what other people had to say so I can honestly say I readÂ  A LOT of blogs.Â Reading blogs went something like this: if I liked a blog I would start following that blogger. In addition, I would read who that blogger followed and start reading those blogs.Â  Then I learned about RSS, which is one place where I could go to see if there was a new postÂ for all the blogs that IÂ  was following.Â There are some amazing bloggers out there who opened up my thinking. In fact, the inspiration for this post comes from reading Alan LevineÂ post <a title=\"The Question Should Be Why Are You Not Blogging\" href=\"http://cogdogblog.com/2012/09/01/the-question/\" target=\"_blank\">The Question Should Be: Why Are You *Not* Blogging</a>. It occurred to me after reading that post that the real reason I should blog is for myself. It is okay to record my thoughts. Everything does not always have to beÂ about teaching someone else, it is can be for my personal learning.</p>\n<p>When I found twitter everything changed for me. I loved the fact that it was instant, it was in the moment. I could get instant feedback. That was so cool for me.Â I have been on Twitter for a couple of years. I have to be honest when I first started Twitter took a little getting used to. I thought I had to follow everyone who followed me but I quickly learned that was not necessary. Twitter helped meÂ  develop a more selective way of getting my information. I still read blogs but twitter helps me find the kind of information I want from the people I can rely on. <a href=\"http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/my-personal-learning/gym-window/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-630\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-630\" title=\"gym window\" src=\"http://cathygermano.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/gym-window.jpg?w=300&h=200\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a></p>\n<p>Which brings me to my current interest Open Education and MOOCs. I was reading my Twitter feed when I saw Clint LaLondeÂ tweet about a MOOCÂ facilitated by George Siemens called Open Education. #oped12Â Â I was so excited because he was a guest speaker in another MOOC I was involvedÂ in called #ec&amp;i 831.Â Â His presentation intrigued me to take a closerÂ look into what it meant toÂ be openÂ in education.Â Â Â I like thinking about what that would look like in the future. I am looking forward to the dialogue and interaction. Have you ever been involved with a MOOC? What was your experience?</p>\n<br />Filed under: <a href=&apos;http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/category/oped12/&apos;>#oped12</a>, <a href=&apos;http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/category/social-media-2/&apos;>Social Media</a> Tagged: <a href=&apos;http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/tag/oped12/&apos;>#oped12</a>, <a href=&apos;http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/tag/george-siemen/&apos;>George Siemen</a>, <a href=&apos;http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/tag/massive-open-online-course/&apos;>Massive open online course</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cathygermano.wordpress.com/616/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cathygermano.wordpress.com/616/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=cathygermano.wordpress.com&#038;blog=14851522&#038;post=616&#038;subd=cathygermano&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(140,0,0,'Career Decisions','text/html','http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/2012/08/30/career-decisions/','Uncategorized;career;college;passion',NULL,NULL,6,NULL,NULL,NULL,12,'This past week as my husband and I drove my middle child back to college I got to thinking about her road ahead.

She will be graduating in May and her future has yet to be realized. While she is thinking of the fun and the internships she hopes to land, IÂ am focusing on what is she going to do when school ends. Unlike her older sister who went to college knowing exactly where she wanted to live and what she wanted to do with her life, the middle child has never had a clear idea. Two weeks after the older child graduated from college, she was living in the city she always dreamed of and is in the profession she always wanted. (Writing) Did her passion pull her into her vocation? I am not sure, I know two years later she is loving her work.</p>\n<p>The middle childÂ is well-rounded and is academically successful. She knows her strengths and she knows her limits. This sort of knowledge is important when making career decisions.Â  She told us long ago she could not work behind a desk for 40 hours a week. She said she needs a degree of unpredictability in her profession. As scary as that sounds to me she told me that is what feeds her creativity. Therefore, I have decided to let her work it out for herself. Let life take its course and whateverÂ job she getsÂ when college ends we will be there to support her.</p>\n<p>Then I read a post by Dean Shareski <a title=\"Stop Following Your Passions The Celebration of Work\" href=\"http://ideasandthoughts.org/2012/08/22/stop-following-your-passions-the-celebration-of-work/\" target=\"_blank\">Stop Following Your Passions&#8230;The Celebration of Work</a>Â in which he suggests that one&#8217;s passion and vocation does not have to be one in the same. This made me feel a little better about the discussions we had with our middle child. It also got me to thinking a little deeper about college.</p>\n<p>This leads me to question what are the determining factors in deciding one&#8217;s future? <a href=\"http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/2012/08/30/career-decisions/5-12/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-610\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-610 alignright\" title=\"Runners \" src=\"http://cathygermano.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/5-12.jpg?w=300&h=200\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>WhatÂ influencesÂ our career decisions?Â Â For example, my youngest is a senior in high school. He has proven he is a very talented runner and loves it. TheÂ college discussion isÂ nowÂ alteredÂ based on his athletic scholarship ability.Â  Should his talent determine his future?Â He has enjoyed engineering courses but now is unsure.Â  His recent successes on the track has changed his academic focus. Should he follow sports related fields? Where will his athletic abilities take him?Â Will he still enjoy running in a much more competitive environment? I do not have the answers.Â  I guess time and hard work will tell.</p>\n<br />Filed under: <a href=&apos;http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/category/uncategorized/&apos;>Uncategorized</a> Tagged: <a href=&apos;http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/tag/career/&apos;>career</a>, <a href=&apos;http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/tag/college/&apos;>college</a>, <a href=&apos;http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/tag/passion/&apos;>passion</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cathygermano.wordpress.com/609/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cathygermano.wordpress.com/609/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=cathygermano.wordpress.com&#038;blog=14851522&#038;post=609&#038;subd=cathygermano&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(141,0,0,'School is Out But Learning Still Goes On','text/html','http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/2012/07/25/school-is-out-but-learning-still-goes-on/','Conferences;edcamps;Professional development;edcamp;Learning',NULL,NULL,6,NULL,NULL,NULL,12,'I get upset with myself when I look back at my blog and see that I have not regularly been keeping up.

I love to read and experiment with technology and photography. Most summers besides taking the annual vacation to the Adirondacks with my husband and children, I spend my time taking part in webinars, reading, following Twitter and connecting with other educators. If there is aÂ conference I am interested in andÂ it isÂ  availableÂ on live stream I will watch. When there is no feed I will follow the hashtag of the <a href=\"http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/2012/07/25/school-is-out-but-learning-still-goes-on/twitter-densi2012-feed/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-590\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-590\" title=\"Twitter #densi2012 feed\" src=\"http://cathygermano.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/twitter-densi2012-feed.png?w=300&h=292\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"292\" /></a>conference to see what I miss.Â Â Some ofÂ myÂ favorite people, the onesÂ I follow on twitterÂ Â present at conferences all across the world. One thing that I like about TwitterÂ Â is that I can get other people&#8217;s perspective of the conference and presentations by followingÂ on Twitter.Â I feel it gives me a deeper understanding and it helps me grow. It sends me on new paths to explore.</p>\n<p>I was reading about <a title=\"unconfernce\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference\" target=\"_blank\">unconferences</a> when I came upon an article byÂ Mary Beth HertzÂ called <a title=\"Introduction to Edcamp: A New Conference Model Built on Collaboration\" href=\"http://www.edutopia.org/blog/about-edcamp-unconference-history\" target=\"_blank\">Introduction to Edcamp: A New Conference Model Built on Collaboration</a>. After reading the article and clicking on a few links I realized I reallyÂ liked how edcamps are organized and run. Having never been to one I decided I would try it.Â I spotted a linkÂ in the article that listed upcoming edcamps.Â I signed up for one which is being held not to far from here. I contacted a few friends to see if they would be interested in attending.Â  Even if they can&#8217;t make it, I look at it as anÂ opportunity toÂ meet new people and make new connections. The conference is in a couple weeks. I got an email today with a link to a google form. The organizers have created a google form that will feed into a googleÂ spreadsheetÂ listing the attendees and some background information on them. This way you can visit other people&#8217;s blogs, see what they are interested in getting out of the conference and what they are comfortable sharing or presenting. I filled out my form and am excited to attend.</p>\n<p>This is how I am spending my summer learning, what are you doing? Â Have you ever attended an unconference?

I was hoping that my district would change and move forward. I read and talked to people on twitterÂ about change happening around Â the world. After a recent meeting with administrators and the technology coordinatorÂ in my district I have come to the conclusionÂ we are not moving in the same direction. That is a scary outlook when you think about it. Then I started thinking about this past fall, the joy and excitement I had in a class I joined <a title=\"#eci831\" href=\"http://eci831.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">#ECI831</a>.Â  One of the guest speakers wasÂ <a title=\"Dave Cormier\" href=\"http://davecormier.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dave Cormier</a>.Â On this particular nightÂ a portionÂ ofÂ theÂ class discussion revolved around three outcomesÂ the workers, soldiers, and nomads.Â Â At the timeÂ I did notÂ apply his theories to my own life. It is only now as I try to make sense of where and what I need for the future does his words have importance in my life. He believed learning should be self-directed which I agree with. That is why I feel like I have to discover new paths. Leave and look for new opportunities.</p>\n<h2>Old Assumption</h2>\n<p>Before I graduated from grad school, I thoughtÂ once I had the degree and the credentialsÂ then I would have the ticket, the positionÂ would be there. I would be happy and free to do whatÂ is needed to help others understand the world in which we live. I was wrong on that one.</p>\n<p>Which brings me to the ultimateÂ question I have asked myself, &#8220;What do you want to do with yourself?&#8221; I realized the answer to that question after reading Dean Shareski&#8217;s posting <a title=\"Understanding the Digital Divide\" href=\"http://ideasandthoughts.org/2012/02/03/understanding-the-digital-divide/\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding the Digital Divide</a>. I am looking to connect with people and ideas, be part of a community who cares about learning. My degree, MSEDÂ Educational Technology is what I worked so hard to obtain.Â  I love the excitement and creative nature that the field has to offer. The novelty of theÂ acquiring the latestÂ hardware and new tools no longer satisfies me.Â  So what do I want to focus my energies on? I guess it has to do with connecting with different people from around the world. I agree with Dean when heÂ mentions the divide is vast. I have witnessed that similar experiences. But I think this is what has shaped my thinking most of all. I want to be someone to help narrow that gap. I likeÂ connecting with others, sharing, and creating learning experiences that are authentic and rich. There you have it, what I want to do!</p>\n<p>I did not attend the EduconÂ conference but I do know if I want to follow the discussions and issues I can findÂ more informationÂ online via TwitterÂ using #educon.

That phone call has altered my life. The news was not good, her husband&#8217;s trip to the doctor&#8217;s office revealed he has brain cancer. His prognosis is not good. We are searching for answers and working against time.Â This post reveals how after deep Â personalÂ reflection the need to write and reflect helps us learn. Please read on to understand my story.</p>\n<p>Time is a very important commodity. I now cherish it in many ways. One way is because I have very little time to do what I love doing. I have not been able to stay connected and I am sad about that because I feel I was just beginning to get myÂ voice. IÂ am involved in a <a title=\"mooc\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course\">mooc</a> as aÂ  mentor in this amazingÂ grad course <a title=\"#eci 831\" href=\"http://eci831.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">#eciÂ 831</a>. The course is now ending and I did not get to share as much as I liked but what I feelÂ is more important is that I made some connections. These connectionsÂ have been added to my growingÂ <a title=\"PLN\" href=\"http://www.teachingvillage.org/2009/09/10/what-is-a-pln-anyway/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TeachingVillage+%28Teaching+Village%29\">PLN</a>. <a href=\"http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/2011/12/05/the-importance-of-social-media-in-education/twitter-map-of-followers/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-544\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-544\" title=\"Twitter map of followers\" src=\"http://cathygermano.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/twitter-map-of-followers.png?w=300&h=88\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"88\" /></a> One such connection you should check out is <a title=\"onepercentyellow\" href=\"http://onepercentyellow.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">onepercentyellow</a>Â She is one creative individual! So in time I know in time I will be back doingÂ the thingsÂ I love to do-learning and sharing with others!</p>\n<p>I am spending more time connectingÂ with my family. This is anotherÂ example ofÂ cherished time.Â Â Although they are miles away, we are in constant communication everyday. <em>Having</em> a family <strong>and</strong> <em>staying in contact </em>with my family (sisters, brother, nieces, nephews)Â is a tough juggling act but it is what needs to come first. Weekends are now spent on the road.Â This news has changed all of us but it also made me realize something I knew all along.Â  We are a close family and we draw strength from each other. We are there for each other. When I started thinking about this I realized it is similar to twitter and forming a PLN. That brought me back here.</p>\n<p>So below you will see the draft that I started before the phone call.Â  The original title was called Introducing Twitter to Friends but when I came back to write a post I noticed this draft was the last time I was on my blog. That made me stop and think-what should I do with this draft? Should I scrap it or make use of what I felt was important? I feel it is important to post it now because for me it was a reminder of what is important and why I feel social media is important in education.Â  So here is the post:</p>\n<p>Recently I met up with some friends who I haven&#8217;t seen in over a year. They were in town for a conference and I enjoy going out to dinner and catching up. Our common bond is that we are all educators. One of the highlights of our get together is that we share what we are doing professionally. I being the techie of the group, thrive on developing my PLN and encouraging my friends who do not use social media to try it. So this post goes out to ValÂ &amp; Emily and anyone else who is a little hesitantÂ onÂ how to getÂ started using twitter.</p>\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<p>To start you will need to go to <a href=\"http://twitter.com\" target=\"_blank\">twitter</a> and create an account. They will ask you to create a username, password, and ask you for an email account. Once you have an account you can change the look of your account in the settings tab.</p>\n<h2>In the Beginning</h2>\n<p>Twitter is different than blogging because you only get 140 characters to use toÂ write your message. This may seem hard but after reading twitter for a while you will notice there areÂ shortcuts to writing.Â One of my biggest suggestions to someone who is just starting out is to find people you have similar interests with and follow them. To find people with similar interestsÂ check out thisÂ list <a title=\"Twitter Chat Schedule\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhisaMy5TGiwcnVhejNHWnZlT3NvWFVPT3Q4NkIzQVE#gid=135\" target=\"_blank\">twitterÂ chat schedules</a>. Here is another post I came across. The title grabbed my attentionÂ  <a href=\"http://edge.ascd.org/_Twitter-Series-What-Do-I-Wish-I-Had-Known-Before-I-Started/blog/5207803/127586.html\" target=\"_blank\">What Do I Wish I Knew Before I Got Started?</a> This is when my phone rang and the post ended.</p>\n<p>So now I sit here in the present and I do not have time to finish this long explanation of how to use twitter for my friends who are not familiar with twitter. So this is what I did- I went to my twitter account and found an excellent explanation. I knew there were others who had written on this topic. It was a matter of finding one and sharing it since I do not have the time to finish this explanation. Here it is <a title=\"Twitter for Beginners\" href=\"http://bit.ly/dQQCqU\">Twitter for Beginners</a>Â by @cybraryman1.Â Â This is a great post and covers a lot of ground. I recommend following @cybraryman1 on twitter. There you have it my original intention (introducing my friends to twitter)Â is now complete.</p>\n<p>In closing, I want toÂ add a few other mentions. IÂ wantÂ toÂ acknowledgeÂ @intrepidteacherÂ <a href=\"http://www.jabizraisdana.com/\">JabizÂ Raisdana </a>for hisÂ video <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/5143613\">Life as an Open Book </a>that helped meÂ with this post.Â  Another person I would like to thank is <a href=\"http://ideasandthoughts.org/\">Dean </a><a href=\"http://ideasandthoughts.org/\">Shareski</a>.

IÂ am tempted to describe the class in this post then I decided it did not matter, what matteredÂ is what I did to solve this problem. <a href=\"http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/2011/10/11/evaluating-learning/teachers-cannot-be-leaders-until-they-understand-students/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-471\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-471\" title=\"Teachers cannot be leaders until they understand students\" src=\"http://cathygermano.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/teachers-cannot-be-leaders-until-they-understand-students.jpg?w=300&h=199\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" /></a></p>\n<p>So each day I would come home and reflectÂ on my day.Â  What I came up with was each of us has aÂ different teaching philosophyÂ and we were all on different paths.Â Now the question is how do we bridge the gap? How do we engage our students when the educators do not agree on the same approach?</p>\n<p>Then yesterday it came to meÂ when one of my colleaguesÂ was teaching a reading comprehension strategy. She was modeling her thinking process. I think this is important for young students to see and experience. I went over to my bag and pulled out my <a href=\"http://www.theflip.com/en-us/\" target=\"_blank\">flip camera </a>and proceeded to tape her lesson. For me, this is something I do when I see somethingÂ valuable in the learning process. Sometimes it is when a teacher teaches a lesson other times it is when I see students collaborating, investigating, discovering or creating. Here is the video, I apologize it is not the best quality but it was done on the spot.</p>\n<a href=\"http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/2011/10/11/evaluating-learning/\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/pK61P-ghI-Q/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n<p>Today I told the students we were going to watch the video. The students reacted with excitement. As the video played I stood looking at them as they watched the video. It was very different from when the teacher was in front of the room teaching them the reading strategies. Yesterday they were slumped in their chairs, some playing with their pencils and papers, others not paying attention at all.Â Now all the students were sitting up attentively, eyes transfixed on the screen.Â  I think they were looking for themselves on the video but I purposely did not include them becauseÂ I wanted toÂ focus entirely on the teacher and her delivery. I let them watch and see for themselves.</p>\n<p><strong><a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"My Reflection\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Reflection\" rel=\"wikipedia\">My Reflection</a></strong></p>\n<p>My first thought as I grabbed my camera was I had toÂ keepÂ the lesson so we did not have to reteach it over and over to the students not paying attention.Â Â I think the videoÂ is a good resource thatÂ should be embedded to our class wiki. As educators we are always trying to share with our parents strategies that help students learn and what better way than to let them<em> see</em> it in action.Â Â But now looking back I thinkÂ there is aÂ more powerful message.</p>\n<p>What occurred to me isÂ that the very act of videotaping our lessonÂ is how <em>we can analyze ourselves</em> teaching.Â  This is how we become better educators. The &#8220;Ah Ha&#8221; moment has arrived! This is how the teachers in the room can mesh their teaching philosophies. We can see what works and what does not engage our students.</p>\n<p>Which brings me to the question ofÂ videotapingÂ lessons. Some educators are reluctantÂ to beÂ videotapedÂ and I understand their nervousness but at the same time tremendous growth can beÂ achieved.Â  Therefore, how will the videoÂ be used becomes the big question. Here is an article from the Washington Post on the subject of <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/answer-sheet/guest-bloggers/videotaping-teachers-the-right.html\" target=\"_blank\">Teacher Evaluations</a>.

I am confident that if I can get one teacher up and blogging the idea will catch on. The big plan is to get everyone in the building making global connections! But I will take one step at a time. It is encouraging when the year starts out so positive! How is the beginning of your school year?

The students would want to take turns reading and flipping.Â <em>Â  </em>I know technological advances displace older or obsolete models but this is a keeper and I hope my flip goes on to a long life.</p>\n<p>Image Credits</p>\n<p>Flip camera by CGermano24</p>\n<p>Students flipping Reading Buddies by CGermano24</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related Articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.edugeek.net/forums/news/74262-cisco-scraps-flip-video-camera.html\">Cisco scraps the Flip video camera</a> (edugeek.net)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.blippitt.com/flip-video-camera-gets-the-killswitch-rip\">Flip Video Camera Gets the Killswitch: RIP</a> (blippitt.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<br />Filed under: <a href=&apos;http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/category/education/&apos;>Education</a>, <a href=&apos;http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/category/technology/&apos;>Technology</a>, <a href=&apos;http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/category/tools/&apos;>Tools</a> Tagged: <a href=&apos;http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/tag/cisco-systems/&apos;>Cisco Systems</a>, <a href=&apos;http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/tag/flip-video/&apos;>Flip Video</a>, <a href=&apos;http://cathygermano.wordpress.com/tag/video-camera/&apos;>Video camera</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cathygermano.wordpress.com/413/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cathygermano.wordpress.com/413/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=cathygermano.wordpress.com&#038;blog=14851522&#038;post=413&#038;subd=cathygermano&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(149,0,0,'Kenan DoÄŸulu is Bob Marley&#8230;.','text/html','http://openeduodyssey.wordpress.com/2012/08/20/kenan-dogulu-is-bob-marley/','ds106;On/In the WebAssignments209;WebAssignments',NULL,NULL,7,NULL,NULL,NULL,13,'At lease according to Google Translate.Â  This is Google&#8217;s translation of Kenan DoÄŸulu&#8217;s Turkish Wikipedia page. &#160; Translation: Bob Marley (May 31, 1974; Cihangir , Beyoglu , Istanbul, Turkey ), Turkish musician.

Maybe another time? Presumably, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/04/bret-easton-ellis-james-deen-fifty-shades\">title of the book</a> comes from a song \"<a href=\"http://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/the_6ths/night_falls_like_a_grand_piano-lyrics-1233762.html\">Night falls like a grand piano</a>\" â€“ but I use the title to point to and reflect on the current flux in the state of higher and distance education.</p>\n<p>The title of (and the picture used in) the blog also have another basis, namely the article by Raymond (2005) titled \"<a href=\"http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1472/1387\">The cathedral and the bazaar</a>\" in which he reflects on the history of Linux in the broader context of traditional software development. In stark contrast to the development of Linux as <em>open</em> software, traditional software development \"needed to be built like cathedrals, carefully crafted by individual wizards or small bands of mages working in splendid isolation, with no beta released before its time\" (para.3).Â  Contrary to this development style, the development of Linux resembled \"a great babbling bazaar of different agendas and approaches... out of which a coherent and stable system could seemingly emerge only by a success of miracles\" (para.4). The combination of these two unlikely sources resulted in me adapting a painting by Brueghel (1559), \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fight_Between_Carnival_and_Lent\">The battle of </a><a href=\"http://opendistanceteachingandlearning.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/cathedralmarket1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-425\" title=\"CathedralMarket\" src=\"http://opendistanceteachingandlearning.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/cathedralmarket1.jpg?w=300&h=212\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"212\" /></a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fight_Between_Carnival_and_Lent\">carnival and Lent</a>\" in a palette of different tones of grey. In the painting by Brueghel, the tensions, transitions and seemingly folly of abstinence and piety in a time of abundance are portrayed. Another parallel with the flux in higher education? [The original painting by Brueghel is rich in colour â€“ see the picture on the right]</p>\n<p>Before harvesting some thoughts from Raymond (2005) to serve as pointers for understanding the different shades of grey in higher and distance education, let me stop for a moment and reflect on the difference between higher education as a cathedral or as a bazaar. I don&apos;t think binaries are always appropriate or useful &#8211; between stark black and lily white there are most probably more than fifty shades of grey. In the same way, I suspect there are a range of possibilities between higher education as a cathedral on the one end of the scale, and higher education as a noisy bazaar on the other end of the scale.</p>\n<p>A long time ago (when bondage used to mean something else...), higher education institutions were cathedrals where the liturgy and sacraments of knowledge and eternal employment were served to those permitted into the sanctuaries, strictly monitored by canons and councils with different hierarchies of admission requirements and access to knowledge was protected, often at all cost. The discourses and epistemologies in these cathedrals were coded and the algorithms for these codes were not shared. Distance education changed some of these traditions by opening up the doors of the cathedral to those who would never have been allowed to enter. Needless to say that cathedrals frowned (and are to some extent still frowning) on distance education as somehow of lesser quality.</p>\n<p>On the other end of the scale are recent developments in higher education <em>as bazaar</em> â€“ full of noise, different stalls with vendors trying to outdo one another by offering a range of products and experiences ranging from massive open online courses or MOOCs (with all the different variants and hybrids), Little Open Only Courses (<a href=\"http://serendipity35.net/index.php?/archives/2630-Are-LOOCs-the-anti-MOOCs.html\">LOOCs, of anti-MOOCs</a>), <a href=\"http://www.udacity.com/\">Udacity</a> ( \"a totally new kind of learning experience\"), <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/\">EdX</a> (\"The Future of Online Education For anyone, anywhere, anytime\"), <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/\">Coursera</a> (\"Take the World&#8217;s Best Courses, Online, For Free\"), <a href=\"http://www.khanacademy.org/\">Khan Academy</a> (\"Learn almost anything for free\"), <a href=\"http://www.pearsonhighered.com/\">Pearson higher education</a> (\"Always learning\") and a range of hybrids, blends, mutations and shades of grey. In this bazaar there are some stalls with agreements with cathedrals while other stalls are in competition with the cathedrals, opening up the sacrament of knowledge to those &apos;on the outside.&apos; There are also, curiously, some cathedrals, with banners waving and choirs singing, joining the fray of the bazaar.</p>\n<p>[<em>On a side note:</em> Making matters even more interesting, is the fact that many of the bazaars are hosted on the premises of the cathedrals (but never, o never on the inside...). Access to the sacrament of accreditation by these cathedrals is still for those carefully selected, hand-picked individuals â€“ which may not be a bad thing â€“ we don&apos;t want to barbarians inside, do we?]</p>\n<p>It is therefore interesting to listen to the noise of the bazaar as we try to define, claim and defend different definitions of distance learning, online and e-learning, distributed-, flexible and open learning, open distance learning (ODL), open distance and e-learning (ODeL), MOOCs, LOOCs, flipped classrooms and Bring-Your-Own-Device-Learning (BYOD) to mention but a few terms. It is as if the each stall tries to outdo the next stall in the marketplace by claiming uniqueness. Higher education theorists (those who have not given up on making sense of the cabal) are either paralyzed by the flux (the moment they define a term it changes into something else), or raise the alarm by defending the different definitions by meticulously listing the &apos;true&apos; characteristics of each of these in-flux forms.</p>\n<p>Let us now return to Raymond&apos;s (2005) article \"The cathedral and the bazaar\" in which he highlights a number of issues we may want to reflect upon. He writes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\"Good programmes know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).\" This seems to eerily remind me of the obsession of many faculty to attempt to write so-called original materials while there are so much excellent materials, content and objects already out there. As more and more of the cathedrals gracefully share their excellent materials, the majority of faculty should embrace the re-use, remix and contextualize those materials and codes. In higher education as bazaar, the value proposition of many higher education has changed from content creation to the mediation of learning.</li>\n<li>Â \"Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.\" In open higher education, peer review is often immediate and often much more thorough and open than traditional peer-review systems of accrediting bodies and editorial boards.</li>\n<li>\"In the cathedral-builder view of programming, bugs and development problems are tricky, insidious, deep phenomena. It takes months of scrutiny by a dedicated few to develop confidence that you&apos;ve winkled them all out. Thus the long release intervals and the inevitable disappointment when long-awaited releasers are not perfect. In the bazaar view, on the other hand, you assume that bugs are generally shallow phenomena â€“ or, at least, that they turn shallow pretty quick when exposed to a thousand eager co-developers pounding on every single new release.\" The medical community&apos;s response to new mutations in viruses where knowledge is shared by a global range of researchers is one example of this sharing and collaboration. How much more can our understanding and sense-making improve as we open up the hallowed spaces of knowledge production?</li>\n<li>\"Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong\" and \"When you hit the wall in development, it&apos;s often time to ask not whether you&apos;ve got the right answer, but whether you&apos;re asking the right question.\" Maybe someone should tell management and faculty?</li>\n<li>\"It&apos;s fairly clear that one cannot code from the ground up in bazaar style. One can test, debug, and improve in bazaar style, but it would be very hard to <em>originate</em> a project in bazaar mode.\" <em>This point is sobering.</em> Don&apos;t we expect the wrong things from our workshops and think-tanks where management often await the group to develop code from afresh?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>In closing:</em> I realise there is a vast difference between the world of programming and the complex, messy and noisy world of higher and distance education as bazaar. Despite these differences, I think the current bazaar-like state of higher and distance education prompts us to rethink many of our assumptions, definitions and traditional defences of higher education as cathedral. The noise from the bazaar heralds in a new age of flux and fifty shades of grey...</p>\n<br /> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/opendistanceteachingandlearning.wordpress.com/421/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/opendistanceteachingandlearning.wordpress.com/421/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=opendistanceteachingandlearning.wordpress.com&#038;blog=27264710&#038;post=421&#038;subd=opendistanceteachingandlearning&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(151,0,0,'Tensions and tipping points in higher and distance education','text/html','http://opendistanceteachingandlearning.wordpress.com/2012/09/10/tensions-and-tipping-points-in-higher-and-distance-education/','OMDE601;distance education;e-learning;EdX;higher education;ICT;Kahn Academy;Laura Czerniewicz;Malcolm Gladwell;mobile learning;MOOC;online courseware;open distance learning;technology;Udacity',NULL,NULL,8,NULL,NULL,NULL,14,'The use of a particular set of metaphors or expressions during the First Unisa International ODL conference hosted 5-7 September 2012, prompted me to think about organisational change in higher and distance education.

Though it is possible that other metaphors were used during this conference, I am specifically referring to expressions such as \"the train has left the station, if you are not on board, you are left behind\", \"the boat has left the harbour\" and \"we are at a tipping point.\"</p>\n<p>These metaphors and expressions reflect individuals&apos;, and possible the collective sense of the delegates, that the context of higher and distance education has irrevocably changed due to primarily three factors. Firstly, there is the impact of the digitization of content, teaching and learning â€“ changing not only higher education&apos;s value proposition, but also our pedagogies, the skills faculty and students need as well as assessment and accreditation. There is also the impact of not only the use of and access to a range of mobile devices but also the impact of the mobility of learners and faculty on learning and teaching. The third factor shaping higher and distance education is the impact of open education (including teaching, learning, assessment and accreditation) and open scholarship. Interestingly, though none of the keynotes or workshop facilitators used the metaphors or expressions of trains leaving stations or tipping points, all the keynotes emphasized and provide ample evidence for the changing context and its impact on teaching, scholarship and learning.</p>\n<p>Expressions such as \"the train has left the station, if you are not on board, you are left behind\"; \"the boat has left the harbour\" and \"we are at a tipping point\" signify a belief or sense that we have reached a situation where <em>there is no turning back</em> to a pre-digital, pre-mobile and pre-open age. Though this is, in general, true in the broader context of higher and distance education, I am not necessarily convinced that these expressions take into account the complexities and idiosyncrasies of different contexts and different powers with vested interests in either frustrating organisational change or actually, preventing it.</p>\n<p>Quoting from popular science authors may lack academic decorum, but I want to use some of the thoughts by Malcolm Gladwell (2000) in \"The tipping point. How little things can make a big difference\" as starting point.\" He explores how epidemics develop and reach a certain &apos;tipping point&apos; after which there is no turning back. From the basis that there is a correlation between tipping points in epidemics and social movements, he then proposes some pointers for thinking about tipping points in societal change. Gladwell claims that there are three essential interdependent factors namely the role of a few extraordinary people, the \"stickiness\" of the message and the \"power of context\" (Gladwell, 2000, p.29).</p>\n<p>The first aspect in understanding and creating tipping points is the role of connectors, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maven\">mavens</a>, and sales persons.Â  Connectors have their feet in different worlds and contexts, and mavens are not \"passive collectors of information\" but they share whatever they know with a range of others (Gladwell, 2000, p.62). Mavens are Â \"information brokers, sharing and trading what they know\" (p.69) or \"data banks\" passing what they know through connectors to sales persons that persuade their audiences (p.70). The stickiness factor refers to the ability of the message to &apos;stick&apos;, to appeal, and to convince. The third factor is the role of context and community â€“ where change happens and is sustained in \"close-knit\" groups. Gladwell suggests that underlying successful social epidemics \"is the bedrock belief that change is possible, that people can radically transform their behaviour or beliefs in the face of the right kind of impetus\" (2000, p.258).</p>\n<p>I must confess that on first reading Gladwell&apos;s (2000) book a number of years ago, I was taken in by the simplicity of his message. It seemed so simple â€“ add, like the <a href=\"http://www.enotes.com/shakespeare-quotes/eye-newt-toe-frog\">witches in Macbeth</a>, the three ingredients, and voila, you have an epidemic or social movement.Â  I am afraid it is not so simple... There are some tipping points in society and organisations that bear testimony to the fact that change is not always beneficial or good. An example that comes to mind is the genocide in Rwanda where all three factors (connectors, mavens and sales persons), a \"sticky message\" (Tutsis are cockroaches) andÂ  a particular context were all present with disastrous results. Interestingly, technology, and specifically radio played a huge part in creating and sustaining the systematic slaughter of close to 800,000 people (see <a href=\"http://ics-www.leeds.ac.uk/papers/pmt/exhibits/2192/Rwandaradio.pdf\">Kellow &amp; Steeves</a>, 1998).</p>\n<p>A second possible critique is that although the pointers Gladwell (2000) provides are useful in reflecting on tipping points <em>in the past</em>, it is more difficult to use his pointers <em>to plan</em> organisational change in higher and distance education.Â  We may have a few extraordinary people, and a \"sticky&#8221;message but our contexts and the different realities and power-relations frustrate or prevent institutional change. Looking at the dramatic changes higher and distance education institutions are facing, those eager for change often express their intense discomfort with the slow pace of change, with expressions such as \"the train has left the station, if you are not on board, you are left behind\", \"the boat has left the harbour\" and \"we are at a tipping point.\" Though I share many colleagues&apos; intense wish for less bureaucracy, more nimbleness in our institutional responses to the tsunami of change facing higher education and a bigger appetite for risk, I am afraid that we should not underestimate the impact of solidified assumptions and beliefs, institutional inefficiencies, institutional and personal ideological agendas and power-relations between the different queen- and kingdoms in higher and distance education institutions. Â We can also not lightly think of our students as collateral damage in realising our dreams for fully online or distributed learning. Add to this witches&apos; brew the impact of broader social, economic and geopolitical forces and we are destined to be increasingly frustrated due to our lack of control as higher and distance education management structures seem to be paralysed by impending changes and the (im)possibility of change. As Laura Czerniewicz (University of Cape Town) pointed out during the conference, higher and distance education is and will be <em>in-tension</em> between different factors pulling us forward and holding us back (see her excellent overview on <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/laura_Cz/icts-higher-education-trends-opportunities-concerns-2012\">ICTs in higher education â€“ some trends, opportunities and concerns â€“ an African perspective</a>).</p>\n<p><em>In closing: </em>Â I have no doubt that the future of higher and distance education will be digital, mobile with an increasing number of pockets of openness impacting on the sharing of resources, assessment, and accreditation. Expressions such as \"the train has left the station, if you are not on board, you are left behind\"; \"the boat has left the harbour\" and \"we are at a tipping point\" therefore signify a belief or sense that we have reached a situation where <em>there is no turning back</em> to a pre-digital, pre-mobile and pre-open age.</p>\n<p>I furthermore believe that many of our traditional classifications such as \"digital natives\" are outdated and lack the necessary nuances to explain and respond to our increasing diverse student and faculty profiles and different levels of preparedness. We need to find ways of telling stories that do not demonize those who are not &#8216;on the train.&#8217; We cannot assume that those &#8216;on the train&#8217; represent the creme de la creme of an institution while the &#8216;others&#8217; are Luddites and backward. In our passion for change, we should embraced more nuanced views, of ourselves and of others.</p>\n<p>I believe that technological and analytical changes are heralding immense possibilities for either decreasing the existing inequalities in the world <em>or</em> perpetuating and increasing intergenerational injustices. We cannot afford to speak lightly of those who cannot afford access to our dreams.</p>\n<p>Expressions such as \"the train has left the station, if you are not on board, you are left behind\", and \"the boat has left the harbour\" may therefore, depending on the context, only be partly true. We should not forget that, depending on the values and insight (or lack of insight) of those in the driver&apos;s seats of our trains and boats, we have no guarantee that the trains and the boats are heading in our preferred directions.Â  After five to ten years, when we look back at 2012 will we be able to state that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course\">Massive Open Online Course</a> (MOOC) movement, <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/\">EdX</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/\">Coursera</a>, <a href=\"http://www.udacity.com/\">Udacity</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.khanacademy.org/\">Khan Academy</a>, Â or our institutional strategies were, in fact, tipping points.</p>\n<p><em>But I have no doubt that the earth is moving beneath our feet...Â  </em></p>\n<p>References</p>\n<p>Gladwell, M.

As higher and distance education institutions respond to this constant flux, we rely more and more on analysis and data to get a grip on what to do next. Though the belief that knowing the past will help us to understand the future is as old as humanity, there is a proliferation of initiatives to harvest and analyse &apos;real-time&apos; data to increase our understanding (and often, control).WeÂ  harvest more and more data from students, faculty and operational systems and processes trying to get one step ahead and lessen the amount of surprises and unforeseen changes in our context which no one foreseen.</p>\n<p>I firmly belief that knowing more and having access to more data, historical and real-time data, <em>may</em> help us to understand and respond to the various challenges our faculty, students and systems face. Knowing more and having more data is however not a magic bullet and often results in an epistemic arrogance making us even more prone to the unforeseen and the unexpected. Considering what higher education has, up to now, done with <em>what we already know</em>, the promise which &apos;big data&apos; holds to help us to understand and plan better, may not be realized. Often what we already know about our students are left unused, or used in \"bang-bang\" approaches as we shoot at noises we hear in the dark.</p>\n<p>Higher education is increasingly living \"under the sword of data\" (Wagner &amp; Ice, 2012, p.40) and we celebrate learning analytics as the \"the new black\" (Booth, 2012, p.52). Learning analytics proposes that if we know more about our students by harvesting the different data trails they leave on course management and student information systems (Oblinger 2012), as well as systems external to higher education (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, etc), we may be able to understand student behaviour better in order to determine their, and our, next moves.Â  Higher education institutions will then be able to suggest courses and actions to students on a similar basis Amazon suggests books you are likely to buy based on analysing your past behaviour. Most institutions also use analytics to identify at-risk students early enough to ensure that institutions do not waste unnecessary resources on students who will, in any event, not make the grade (literally). If these &apos;at risk&apos; students are allowed to register, they are put in appropriate streams according to algorithms harvesting a range of data from primary school and secondary school histories, demographic data and increasingly, data trails and digital records students leave on social networking sites. There are claims that we should have analytics producing 360 degree views of students (Crow, 2012), providing us with flawless ways to prevent wasting resources (on both students&apos; and the institution;s side).</p>\n<p>As I reflected on knowing too little, doing too little with what we already know and our commitment to know even more about our students, I could not help to think of the work of Nicholas Taleb (2007). According to him, the human mind suffers from three ailments, the \"triplet of opacity\" which encompasses</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\"The illusion of understanding, or how everyone thinks he knows what is going on in the world that is more complicated (or random) than they realize;</li>\n<li>The retrospective distortion, or how we can assess matters only after the fact, as if they were in a rearview mirror...</li>\n<li>The overvaluation of factual information and the handicap of authoritative and learned people, particularly when they create categories â€“ when theyÂ  &apos;Platonify&apos;\" Â (Taleb, 2007, p.8)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We often believe that the more we know, the more we will understand â€“ and the causal link between knowing more and understanding does not necessarily exist. We assume that by categorizing what we know, we prove our understanding but Taleb (2012) warns that \"Categorizing is necessary for humans, but it becomes pathological when the category is seen as definitive, preventing people from considering the fuzziness of boundaries, let alone revising their categories \" (p.15). There is a real danger that our obsession with categorizing students as Generation X, Y and Z, or Â as \"Millennials\" or as &apos;at risk&apos; reduces the complexities within different cohorts of students, resulting in homogenous Platonic categories which provide us with the &apos;evidence&apos; to plan interventions and predict future behaviour. Our seeming obsession with predictive modelling and categorization speaks of the \"weight of the epistemic arrogance of the human race\" (Taleb, 2007, p.17).</p>\n<p>As we gather more data resulting in the number of possible different variables impacting on student retention and success increase, we look for linear relationships forgetting that \"linear relationships are truly the exception\" (Taleb 2007, p.89).Â  Humans, and specifically higher education administrators, are \"explanation-seeking animals who tend that everything has an identifiable cause and grab the most apparent one as <em>the</em> explanation\" (Taleb, 2007, p.119). Taleb does not suggest that there are no causal links between variables, but he suggests that we should use the word &#8211; &apos;because&apos;- \"sparingly\" and \"with care\" (2007, p.120). While there is a need to plan and strategize after making sense of the highly dynamic higher education landscape where flux is the new normal, we should be careful of the danger of epistemic arrogance which \"bears a double effect: we overestimate what we know, and underestimate uncertainty\" (Taleb, 2007, p.140). Knowing the limitations of our predictions and knowledge does not result in a paralysis and an inability to plan and predict, but rather allows as to \"...plan <em>while bearing in mind such limitations</em>. It just takes guts\" (Taleb, 2007, p.157; emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Juxtaposed to epistemic arrogance and the \"pretence of knowledge\", Taleb proposes \"epistemic humility\" which he describes as follows: \"Think of someone heavily introspective, tortured by the awareness of his (sic) own ignorance. He lacks the courage of the idiot, yet has the rare guts to say &apos;I don&apos;t know&apos;. He does not mind looking like a fool or, worse, an ignoramus. He will not commit, and he agonizes over the consequences of being wrong. ... This does not necessarily mean that he lacks confidence, only that he holds his own knowledge to be suspect\" Taleb (2007, p.190).</p>\n<p><strong>In closing:</strong> Â I started this blog stating that it is not a good time in higher education to say \"I don&apos;t know.\" As \"explanation-seeking animals\" we constantly look for causal links in the belief that, somehow, life and the lives of our students are more predictable than they really are. We harvest more and more data, looking for causes and links in our endeavour to <em>manage</em> students&apos; learning more effectively.Â  We re-engineer big processes, make big scientific claims based on big data and celebrate the potential of big data mining and analyses in a continuous ritual of epistemic arrogance.Â  We state our claims with the courage of an idiot and banish those who dare to question or who hold their own (and others&apos;) knowledge to be suspect.</p>\n<p>A good place to realise the huge potential of learning analytics in higher and distance education is with a strong dose of \"epistemic humility.\"</p>\n<p>[Image retrieved from <a href=\"http://www.dataminingtechniques.net/\">http://www.dataminingtechniques.net/</a>, 3 September 2012]</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>Booth, M.

Her opinion piece triggered a number of thoughts relating to my commitment in <a href=\"http://opendistanceteachingandlearning.wordpress.com/2012/08/20/romanticizing-the-past-in-higher-and-distance-education/\">last week&#8217;s blog</a> to reflect on romanticizing the impact of technology on the future of higher education. Â I intend to keep my promise, but in an oblique and roundabout way.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt in my mind that the Internet is reshaping how we define and produce knowledge, how we assess, validate and accredit knowledge and the type of graduates we grow. Distance and online education have always been the stepchild of higher education with concerns about the quality of an eduction that is not face-to-face (as if face-to-face warrants good quality...). These concerns have, suddenly disappeared and distance education is en vogue with everyone talking about the Khan Academy, MITx, EdX, Coursera and Udacity. In the corridors of distance education we now ask one another \"did you see what Stanford is doing?\" and \"have you seen the latest course on offer from MITx?\" The stepchild of higher education is suddenly welcomed as a prodigal son or daughter. <em>Online and open education is the new black.</em> There is a lot of hype how online and a particular form of open education will change the playing field in higher education resulting in previously excluded masses now benefitting from the opening of higher eduction. So we dream of a world where using technology will democratize the world, and erase inequalities based on income, race, gender, religion, and class. Technology is heralded as the big equalizer and celebrated as a major factor in bringing down tyrants and exporting a particular gestalt of American democracy.Â Higher education institutions and faculty just cannot afford <em>not</em> to join the technological tango in fear of being caricaturized as luddites and as old-fashioned.</p>\n<p>Excuse me if I sound cynical, but I don&#8217;t belief romanticizing the role of technology in the future of distance and higher education is useful orÂ  valid. Despite glimpses of what technology and access to well-designed online learning can achieve, I believe that technology will continue to serve the dominant interests and beliefs of the day &#8211; like education throughout the ages. While we often focus on the opportunities technology offers, we seem to forget how the same technologies can be used to subjugate, disempower and serve the interests of despots and autocratic regimes or neoliberal market ideologies (see for example Morozov, 2011). Technology and the educational use of technology is <em>not an unqualified good.</em>Â I agree with Gray (2004, p. 70) who warns that knowledge and science cannot (and will not) \"end the conflicts in history. It is an instrument that humans use to achieve their goals, whether winning wars or curing the sick, alleviating poverty or committing genocide.\"</p>\n<p>Having now made the case for neither a romanticizing of the past of higher education nor romanticizing a technological future, let me return to the statement made by Tanya Gold &#8211; &#8220;Inequality kills.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There is no doubt in my mind that the future of higher education will be digital and mobile. Â We should however take notice of Castells&apos; (2009) warning that networks do not only connect and include but also disconnect and exclude. Without romanticizing technology and the way it will shape higher education, there is no doubt in my mind that we should prepare students and our graduates to <em>participate</em> in a networked world. Not preparing them will permanently destine them to become permanently disenfranchised and an integral part of the wasteland of human progress (e.g. Bauman, 2004).</p>\n<p>I acknowledge that preparing graduates for a digital and networked future in a developing world context is mind-numbing. Concerns about access to the Internet and the cost of access paralyze many higher education institutions in developing countries from embracing educational technologies. Despite and amidst this huge challenge, I believe that we simplyÂ do not have a choice but to use every conceivable means to ensure that students become critical participants in the global networked society. <em>To graduate students who are digitally illiterate is immoral.Â </em></p>\n<p>I had chills down my spine reading Tanya Gold&#8217;s (2012) piece on how increasing inequality <em>permanently</em> affects the social mobility of thousands of people in a so-called developed country. Students&apos; background increasingly determines where they will end up in the pecking order of an unequal society. One particular phrase she uses struck a cord &#8211; she asks : &#8220;Where is the anger?&#8221;</p>\n<p>There is a lot of faculty who are angry and genuinely concerned about the concerted efforts to move distance education in a developing world context to digital and online formats. Taking into account that \"inequality kills\" and that it is more true than ever before that \"where you come from determines where you are going\" â€“ <em>how can we justify not going digital?</em></p>\n<p>In conclusion: We should stop romanticizing the past of higher education. We should also be very wary of attempts to romanticize digital and online learning. Unless we can live with accepting that our graduates may be permanently disenfranchised because they are digitally illiterate, <em>we</em> have no choice. They must realise they don&apos;t have a choice. Inequality kills.</p>\n<p>[Image retrieved from <a href=\"http://liberation.typepad.com/liberation/2010/08/inequality-in-nz-5-david-bromell-on-the-economy-of-ideas.html\">http://liberation.typepad.com/liberation/2010/08/inequality-in-nz-5-david-bromell-on-the-economy-of-ideas.html</a>, 27 August 2012]</p>\n<p>References</p>\n<p>Bauman, Z.

This was the time before the hostile takeover and co-option by regulatory bodies, commercial enterprises, government intervention and the pervasive obsession with markets, profit, reporting cycles and technology. How we miss those times...</p>\n<p>Looking back at those times, we are not only very selective in what we choose to remember, but we are also seemingly oblivious to some unsavoury elements in that same history such as the pervasive discrimination on the basis of race, gender, class and often religion. Â We forget how only the selected few had access to these &apos;sanctuaries of knowledge.&apos; We forget how wealth and power played a role in who was appointed, who was allowed, and who was promoted. We choose not to remember those elements of the same past we romanticize while mourning a loss of identity and bemoaning the fact that higher and distance education is no longer what it used to be.</p>\n<p>Romanticizing the past stands in stark contrast to most of what I currently read which indicates that we are entering a phase in higher education, and distance education in particular, where flux and change will <em>be the new normal</em>. This flux and insecurity is not only endemic to higher education, but to most of our lives â€“ whether reflecting on the continuing economic slump, Â increasing societal unrest or the sound of the tectonic plates of geopolitical alliances moving and clashing.</p>\n<p>Last week Friday, a colleague of mine, Chris Swanepoel introduced me to a video called <a href=\"http://nancy-rubin.com/2012/06/16/epic-2020-higher-education-in-the-year-2020/\">EPIC2020</a>. On her website, Nancy Rubin introduces the movie as follows:</p>\n<p>&#8220;EPIC 2020, the movie, is a dramatization of the technology trends that in the remainder of this decade will eliminate college tuition and degrees. New innovative business models in online learning will generate revenues from the top 1% of students that enable the education of the rest of the world for free. Every student in the world with internet access will be able to be taught by the world&apos;s best professors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Watching the movie, I had shivers down my spine and a mixture of feelings ranging from fear to excitement. Even if half of the predictions in the movie do not realize, we are in for a rough ride. Yet, not everyone sees and accepts that the context and character of higher and distance education has changed dramatically and irrevocably over the last number of years. Â <em>There is no turning back. </em>There is no doubt in my mind that the current corporatization and commodification of higher education <em>is the new normal</em> â€“ whether I agree with it or not. There is furthermore no doubt (at least in my mind) that higher education will become increasingly unbundled in the near future â€“ whereÂ  links between tuition, assessment and accreditation will be severed. Â The granularity of our courses we offer will change dramatically. There is increasing demand for just-in-time learning experiences offered in asynchronous formats allowing for immediate feedback and assessment. There is a need for agility and nimbleness, with shorter development cycles and continuous registration. I sense a move away from assessing outcomes to assessing learners&apos; competencies whenever <em>they</em> are ready to prove their capability. The diversity of our learner profiles with a wide range of educational backgrounds, skills, and aspirations makes the offering of a one-size-fits-all approach increasingly ineffective, and frustrating to both the institution and learners. <em>There is no doubt in my mind that the future of higher education will be digital, open and mobile.</em> We furthermore have the moral responsibility to prepare our graduates for this digital, open and mobile future. Castells (2009, p.25) warns that though not everyone is included in this network society, \"<em>everyone is affected</em> by the processes that take place in the global networks that constitute social structure\" (emphasis added). In this network society \"the global overwhelms the local â€“ unless the local becomes connected to the global as a node in alternative global networks constructed by social movements\" (Castells, 2009, p.26). We therefore have a moral obligation to prepare our graduates to firstly understand the implications of this world, but also to participate in and where necessary formulate alternative counter-narratives. <em>We have no choice.Â </em>Romanticizing the past will not help.</p>\n<p>Despite the sound of the winds of change, we romanticize how we used to teach ten (or more) years ago. With all due respect, how can we think that what and how we taught ten years ago will still be appropriate in the current (and future) era? What makes the tuition and production cycles of 16 years ago so attractive that we contemplate going back? Don&apos;t get me wrong. The one danger is to romanticize the past. Another danger is to romanticize the future where technology will address all societal and educational ills. While both these types of romanticizing are dangerous, I will focus in this blog on the paralyzing impact of romanticizing the past.</p>\n<p>Facing the current issues of corporatization and commodification of higher education, we have a number of choices. We can construct our approach to these changes as necessary counter-narratives aiming to disrupt and decentre academic capitalism and Managerialism.Â  We can also choose to be stuck in discourses of perpetual longing for an archival identity of higher education that, most probably, never was. Memory and tradition then serves as resistance to a future we do not understand and a celebration of a past that possibly never was as we remember it.</p>\n<p>A third option for defining higher and distance education involves a palimpsest approach where the project is not to decentre and contest current changes in higher education but to embrace our historical and current identities as dynamically constructed and fluid at a specific time and place where Â a multiplicity of subject positions become possible. Reflecting on the identity discourses in an African context, Kwame Appiah (1995, p.108) says:</p>\n<p>&#8220;If an African identity is to empower us, so it seems to me, what is required is not so much that we throw out falsehood but that we acknowledge first that race and history and metaphysics do not enforce an identity: that we can choose, within broad limits set by ecological, political, and economic realities what it will mean to be African in the coming years.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If I understand Appiah (1995) correctly, he does not contest the critical interrogation of the factors that shape our identities. Instead of a permanent oppositional stance, he states that \"race and history and metaphysics <em>do not enforce </em>an identity\" (emphasis added). While acknowledging that our identities in higher and distance education are shaped by broader ecological, political, economic and increasingly technological realities, we have a choice.</p>\n<p><em>In conclusion:</em> I firmly believe that there is a place to contest, to formulate counter-narratives, to disrupt and decentre dominant discourses. We should however be careful to romanticize the past as an unqualified good. While romanticizing our archival identities is an option, it will not prepare us for a future that is already here.</p>\n<p>[Image retrieved from <a href=\"http://www.futurity.org/science-technology/memories-reflect-past-anticipate-future/\">http://www.futurity.org/science-technology/memories-reflect-past-anticipate-future/</a>, 20 August 2012]</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>Appiah, K.A.

Considering that distance education has always been known for providing access to students who would have been excluded from higher education opportunities â€“ the demographic profiles, competencies, educational and life-history backgrounds of distance education learners have always been and are becoming even more diverse. Looking at open distance learning (ODL) which celebrates that it is even &apos;more&apos; open than some distance education institutions, the notion of an &apos;average learner&apos; is even more untenable. While the notion of the &apos;average learner&apos; may still be valid in residential and private higher education with stricter admission requirements, I suspect that the massification of public higher education results in the notion of the &apos;average learner&apos; becoming more of a myth than ever before. Taking into account recent developments with regard to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) which literally opens up education opportunities to anyone who has access to the Internet, the notion of the &apos;average learner&apos; is losing its credibility all together.</p>\n<p>Despite the above concerns about the lack of any evidence to support the notion of what an \"average learner\" in distance and open education looks like, we continue to use the concept of the &apos;average learner&apos; in planning how long courses should take, the \"mix\" of pedagogy, technology and support, funding formulas (e.g. full-time equivalents...) and of course, cohort studies and funding formulas.Â  <em>I propose it is time to dump the notion of the &apos;average learner&apos; altogether...</em></p>\n<p>Distance education has long been heralded as the &#8220;most industrialized form of education\" (Peters, 2010) where courses are delivered to masses of students regardless of where they are and often even who they are. In the past, distance education was made possible by a division of labour where courses were designed by cross-functional teams, carefully designed to suit the &#8216;average learner&#8217; who will be able to work through a defined scope of content in a certain number of hours or tuition period. After designing these courses, the content entered a production cycle and was delivered to students in neatly sealed packages. Without this division of labour and the standardisation of tuition cycles and examination dates, distance education would most probably not have been possible. Considering that the affordability of offering courses through distance education depended on issues of scalability and standardisation, the sustainability of distance education depended on carefully balancing \"nice-to-haves\" (whether extra readings, student and lecturer ratios as well as choosing technologies) with the absolute essentials the &apos;average learner&apos; needed to achieve predetermined outcomes of a particular programme or course.</p>\n<p>While the above description may have been universally true of distance education in the past, advances in technology and the affordances of a range of online learning opportunities question our most basic assumptions about the division of labour, tuition cycles, \"materials production\" and of course, the notion of the &apos;average learner&apos;... There is increasing convergence between traditional residential education and distance education with the old absolute boundaries and distinctions disappearing and blurring. And yet, despite these changes, the notion of the &apos;average learner&apos; keeps us captive.</p>\n<p>The notion of the &apos;average learner&apos; runs through distance education provision like a golden thread. In South African higher education, the credits earned by passing a particular course depends on the number of hours the &#8216;average learner&#8217; will need to achieve theÂ envisaged outcomes. Â For example, each credit is equivalent to 10 Â &#8217;notional hours&#8217; Â referring to the time an &#8216;average Â learner&#8217; needs to work through Â the materials, Â complete all the formativeÂ assessment, as well as prepare for and complete the summative assessment. The total scope of a 12 credit module is therefore based on the notion of what an &#8216;average learner&#8217; can achieve in 120 hours.</p>\n<p>The notion of the &apos;average learner&apos; may have been a valid construct in the past, where higher education was only for the elite and selected few (based on gender, race, language, location and/or religion), but as increasing numbers of learners from very diverse backgrounds have access to higher education, distance education and the various forms of open education, the notion of an &apos;average learner&apos; is no longer be valid. Â For example, in the South African context, who is this &#8216;average learner&#8217; in a country still coming to terms with the legacy of apartheid andÂ the vast disparities in educational backgrounds of learners? WhatÂ is &#8216;average&#8217; where most learners entering higher education study in a second or third language? Â What are the alternatives to using the construct of the &apos;average learner&apos; in designing courses thatÂ are comparable with the best international higher education has to offer?</p>\n<p>If we let go of the notion of the &#8216;average learner&#8217; and design courses Â which allows for Â multiple routes towards achieving Â agreed-upon capabilities , then it follows that learners mayÂ take however long it takes them to achieve envisaged competencies. Â Learners who need moreÂ assistance to achieve a certain level of competencyÂ will be able to take alternative and possibly longerÂ routes, while learners whoÂ can prove their competencies in the stipulated outcomes can thenÂ move on to follow-up courses. Yes, this will result in some learners completing a so-called three-year qualification in a shorter period, but where did we get the idea of a &#8220;three-year qualification&#8221; anyway? These time-bound qualifications are most probably left-overs from historical residential higher education where learners could not proceed faster than the schedule of set lectures where a professor will enlighten andÂ fill receptive students like empty vessels who depend totally on the wisdom of the one in front of the class. Distance educationÂ duplicated this beliefÂ into standardised and scalable courses designed on the premise of what an &#8216;average learner&#8217; can achieve in a certain period of time. Â What prevents distance education from offeringÂ well-designed courses allowing forÂ different routes, differentÂ assessmentsÂ and different schedules? Â  Or are weÂ so obsessed with our little boxes and schemata thatÂ we cannot think out-of-the-box?</p>\n<p>Yes, I know our funding frameworks and institutional operational cycles are based on completing \"three-year\" qualifications, but surely this notion goes against the grain of the belief that students are diverse, with diverse life-histories and aspirations, time and resources. <a href=\"http://www.wgu.edu/degrees_and_programs_b\">Western Governors University</a> in the United States of America is already offering competency-based qualifications allowing learners to proceed to follow-up courses as soon as they have proven their capability in preceding courses.</p>\n<p>In conclusion: We are all worried (and very vocal) about the under-preparedness of students for higher education and distance education in particular.

Yet there are many DE institutions that continue as if the systems of yesteryear will guarantee their survival in a digital age. <em>Are they having a Kodak moment?</em></p>\n<p>In stark contrast to Fuji Film who has been able to remain relevant in a digital age, Kodak filed for bankruptcy early in 2012 (see <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2012/01/how-fujifilm-survived?fsrc=scn/tw/te/bl/sharperfocus\">Schumpeter&apos;s analysis</a> in The Economist of 18 January 2012). What did Kodak <em>not</em> see? What did Fuji Film see that Kodak didn&apos;t? What kept Kodak from seeing the danger signals? In which areas did Kodak invest resources in planning for the next 10 years?</p>\n<p>I have a suspicion that many DE institutions have a Kodak moment. Despite general agreement that we are in the midst of a Copernican revolution, many DE institutions continue as if it is business as usual. Not only doÂ they underestimate the immense implications of a digital age, these institutions continue to sustain and even expand legacy systems. Â Legacy systems can be described as systems, processes or technologies that served the institution well but which are out of sync with current and forthcoming changes in the institution&#8217;s context. Examples which come to mind, in the context of DE, are the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintaining and even expanding massive print production systems relying on increasingly ineffective postal delivery systems.</li>\n<li>Expanding office space for permanent faculty and administrative personnel.</li>\n<li>Rolling out massive face-to-face tutorial support systems providing synchronous support to students at scattered locations.</li>\n<li>The Medusian gaze of one-size-fits-all standardization regardless of discipline context, practical work requirements, student profile and access to resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we look at our strategic and operational plans, it would seem as if we invest a lot of energy to keep <em>existing</em> systems in place as if these systems do not have an expiry date. Â I further suspect that the reason why we keep those systems in place is not necessarily because we do not see the changes coming. I rather suspect that our investment in legacy systems is due to a total underestimation of the nature and scope of the changes that higher education will face in the next five to ten years as well as our inability to confront the power bases who have vested interests in sustaining and expanding the existing systems.</p>\n<p>It is not my intention to provide a list of legacy systems that are sustained and expanded, but rather to point to and examine <em>the belief systems and assumptions</em> which provide a basis for investing in these legacy systems. Â Beliefs that come to mind are the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our concept of faculty as referring only to full-time tenured, on-campus academics who are responsible to do discipline-specific research <em>and</em> teach.</li>\n<li>Our belief that all our staff should all be permanently employed and be on campus in permanent offices and centralized campuses.</li>\n<li>Our definitions of and regulations regarding intellectual property rights and protecting our course content.</li>\n<li>Our belief that <em>all</em> learners benefit from highly structured and highly interactive learning environments.</li>\n<li>Our belief that all learners want to complete full programmes and that half-completed programmes are a waste of time.</li>\n<li>Our continuedÂ belief thatÂ we can graduate students whoÂ are information and technologyÂ illiterate.</li>\n<li>Our continued assumption that because I am a discipline expert that I will necessarily be a good teacher.</li>\n<li>Our obsession with using neoliberal market ideological terminology such as &#8220;high performance organisations&#8221;, &#8220;lean and mean&#8221;, &#8220;penetrating markets&#8221;&#8230;</li>\n<li>Our misplaced belief that sending students more and more <em>printed</em> tutorial letters or adding more resources online will make them understand more.</li>\n<li>Our misplaced belief that (all) our students are independent and autonomous learners.</li>\n<li>The belief that students and staff are mere passive recipients of services, instead of seeing staff and students as active agents making choices and having responsibilities.</li>\n<li><em>Sustaining victimhood and sufferingÂ as identity</em> &#8211; whether among students and staff. Yes, many staff and students have been on the receiving end of gross injustices basedÂ on gender, race, language, class, age, etc. ButÂ we should be very careful to sustain environments where victimhood and suffering become permanent and highly valued forms of social capital.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above list is anything but a definitive list of beliefs that sustain legacy systems.Â Despite being incomplete, the list does provide a starting point to think about the choices we have and those we don&apos;t have. As stated earlier, legacy systems are kept in place because individuals and groups either have vested interests in their permanence and expansion or have a lack of comprehension of the dramatic changes that are coming. Having vested interests in sustaining current legacy systems and a lack of understanding of the dramatic changes higher education are facing are not necessarily mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p>There is therefore a real danger of having a Kodak moment and missing the urgency for change where some of the beliefs and the systems they sustain will keep us from responding appropriately and timeously to a future we cannot predict, and most probably don&apos;t understand...</p>\n<p>Schumpeter (2012, Â¶3) writes that \"How Fujifilm succeeded serves as a warning to American firms about the danger of trying to take the easy way out: competing through one&#8217;s marketing rather than taking the harder route of developing new products and new businesses.\" <em>New products and new business means letting go of treasured ways of doing that served the purposes of yesteryear.</em></p>\n<p>Are we courageous enough?

Whether it is studying on their own, or encountering unexpected difficulties in courses or balancing work, studies and personal lives, DE remains a challenge for most students. DE is furthermore infamous for its many casualties in the form of high dropout rates, whether in individual courses or in cohorts of students as they progress through a programme. It is generally accepted that DE students take approximately one-and-a-half times as long (compared to residential institutions) to complete programmes due to different course loads, work-life balance, etc. The concern is not necessarily that DE students take longer to complete &apos;whole&apos; programmes, but that many of them, <em>may actually never complete a full programme.</em> The reasons for this high dropout rate in DE are complex. This blog shares some thoughts on those modules which are known to have notoriously high failure rates resulting in students often repeating the course more than 3 times, and those courses that create barriers to students&apos; completion of their studies, the so-called \"killer courses\".</p>\n<p>Any attempt to understand the various factors impacting on student retention and success in programmes and courses should take cognisance of the fact that student retention and success is, per se, complex. The student journey consists of mostly non-linear, multidimensional, interdependent interactions and variables at different phases in the nexus between student, institution and broader societal factors. Some of the variables impacting on student success originate in the demographic detail, life-worlds, aspirations, schooling background of students. Students&#8217; understanding of why they want to study and how their studies &#8216;fit&#8217; their profiles are furthermore dynamic and may change as their life circumstances change.</p>\n<p>Another set of variables impacting on student success originate in the unique characteristics, values and culture of the delivering institution such as institutional efficiencies <em>or</em> inefficiencies, policy, admission requirements, appropriate use of technology, etc. The fact that both students <em>and</em> institution are also impacted by variables <em>outside</em>Â their locus of control complicates matters even further. Factors such as the global economic downturn resulting in downsizing, unemployment, increasingÂ labour unrest, etc., have major impacts on student and institutional success. When we think about the so-called \"killer courses,\" let us not forget that what happens (or does not happen) in a particular course is the result of many interdependent and often mutually constitutive variables (see Subotzky &amp; Prinsloo, 2011).</p>\n<p>Let us now turn to the so-called \"killer courses\". How should we understand these courses with high dropout or failure rates? The one danger in identifying a course as a \"high risk\" or even a \"killer\" course is that we may think the problem liesÂ only inÂ the content and/or pedagogic structure of the course. We then forget that many factors impacting on student success lie <em>outside</em> the content and/or pedagogic structures of courses. It is so easy to blameÂ academics Â responsible for these courses for Â not doing more to prevent student Â failure Â or dropout, whileÂ many of the variables impacting on dropout and failure fall <em>outside</em> of the loci of control of academics.</p>\n<p>What is the difference between a \"high risk\" course which students repeatedly fail and so-called \"killer courses\"? The latter are those courses which prevent students from completing their qualifications or programmes. I personally don&apos;t like the notion of a \"killer course\" although the term does not leave any doubt what these courses do to students&apos; aspirations and resources. A more appropriate term would be to call these courses \"barriers to registration.\"</p>\n<p>So how do we then respond to high risk courses and those courses which are barriers to completion? My suspicion is that the problem (mostly) does <em>not</em> lie with the course content at all. Â The problem lies in the alchemy or lack of alchemy between individual students&#8217; and the course where there is no &#8216;fit&#8217; between student and module. Though it is always possible to redesign courses and assessments to specifically address difficult threshold concepts, I don&apos;t think this is a silver bullet. It is also not effective to send out yet another tutorial letter to all students. We have to drill down and analyse data to get a sense of where students who repeatedly fail a module go wrong or miss the plot.Â  Once we know where student miss the plot we can plan accordingly. Possible options for interventions include offering individualized e-tutor support to these students. How scalable this option is with regard to student numbers and cost will be determined by the context. A more appropriate option may be to identify \"at risk\" students earlier. Surely we have access to data which provide us crucial information of which students, if they register for particular courses or follow-up courses may be at risk? Research in the context of first-level accounting at Unisa (Du Plessis, MÃ¼ller &amp; Prinsloo, 2005) showed that students who repeat the course have a greater chance of failing it again. If students failed a module for more than three times, even with help, we must seriously consider allowing these students to register for an <em>alternative</em> curriculum whether in the same subject or, where possible and appropriate, in another discipline.</p>\n<p><strong>In conclusion:</strong></p>\n<p>There is enough evidence that indicates that some students are at higher risk to fail certain modules than other students. There is also ample evidence that some modules are, for some students,Â high risk environments or \"killer modules.\" Â We should however be careful to think that the problem lies only in the module itself. TheÂ inability of some students to pass some modules, oftenÂ repeatedly, is more probably found in a lack of &#8216;fit&#8217; between students and module. Institutions have masses of student data which allow us to put systems and processes in place to prevent courses from becoming defined as \"high risk\" or \"barriers to graduation\". The question is not whether we know, but whether we care enough to signpost the minefield, and where possible, provide alternative routes...</p>\n<p>[Image retrieved from <a href=\"http://pixtale.net/2012/03/30-years-since-the-falklands-war/\">http://pixtale.net/2012/03/30-years-since-the-falklands-war/</a> Â ]</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>Du Plessis, A., MÃ¼ller, H., &amp; Prinsloo, P.

Distance education (DE) has, since its early days, boasted that it provides educational opportunities for those excluded from education based on geographical location, employment, cost, etc. \"Opening\" education is therefore part of the DNA of distance education and open distance learning (ODL) in particular.</p>\n<p>Studying through DE or ODL requires much more than just meeting the academic admission requirements of a particular institution. Students are often (mostly?) under-prepared for the challenges that await them. The under-preparedness of students has its origins in a variety of factors such as poor secondary schooling, rote learning, a mismatch between the curricula on secondary school level and first-year higher education, an inability to work independently and... wrong expectations. We underestimate the existential crises students experience when their study packages arrive and they are suddenly confronted with registering on the institutional learning management system (LMS), get access to the prescribed materials and, almost immediately, start preparing for the first assignment.</p>\n<p>By the time students (and the institution) realise that there is a mismatch, or an inappropriate \"fit\" between students (whether &#8217;caused&#8217; by their profile, life circumstances or expectations) and the unique offerings and characteristics of the institution; it is often too late to change or cancel their enrolment without some financial loss to students and institutions alike (Subotzky &amp; Prinsloo, 2011). So, how sure are we which students will \"fit\"? What can we do to ensure an optimal \"fit\" between the aspirations, resources and potential of students and the offerings and characteristics of a DE or ODL institution? How do we ensure that our efforts to increase &#8220;fit&#8221;, don&#8217;t exclude students?</p>\n<p>At the Western Governors University (a DE institution), enrolment is not automatic. Students are screened using the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The results of a personal interview(s) with a WGU Enrolment Counsellor</li>\n<li>Students prior college experience and work experience</li>\n<li>The results from the WGU Collegiate <em>Readiness</em> Assessment (emphasis added)</li>\n<li>The time commitment students can make to their studies</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"right\">Â Â (<a href=\"http://www.wgu.edu/admissions/requirements\">http://www.wgu.edu/admissions/requirements</a>)</p>\n<p>The rationale for these criteria is found in the following statement: \"At WGU we want you to graduate, not just enrol. Consequently, not every applicant is admitted because not every individual is a good \"fit\" for WGU&apos;s programs and competency-based, online academic model.\"</p>\n<p>Since the very early models on student success and throughput, the question of \"fit\" was always on the table (e.g. Spady, 1970; Tinto, 1975). Tinto&apos;s (1975, 1988) work in particular was based on the works by Van Gennep on the nature of &apos;rites of passage&apos; and the philosopher Durkheim&apos;s theory on suicide (Tinto, 1988, pp. 442-447). Durkheim&apos;s theory stated, amongst other things, that one of the reasons (if not the main reason) why people commit suicide is because they felt they did not belong, or they did not fit (anymore). Since then the success with which students were integrated or fitted into higher education was seen as a major variable in determining their chances on success. The more integrated students became into the epistemologies and ways of being of an institution, the bigger the possibility of success. Less integration was equated with lower scores, and eventually, drop out.</p>\n<p>While there have been criticisms against the unilateral expectation of students to fit into higher education (see e.g. Cabrera, Nora &amp; Castaneda, 1993), with no apparent requirement for higher education to also, from their side, fit into the lives of students â€“ most research indicate that the question of \"fit\" is an important element in the student journey.</p>\n<p>If we accept the importance of \"fit\" for now, the question that fascinates and disturbs me is the following:Â <em>How will students know whether they fit or don&apos;t fit?</em>Â Â <em>When will students discover that a particular course or institution is \"not for them\"?Â </em>Â How much time and resources will be wasted before they realise they don&apos;t fit? While the danger of \"not fitting\" exists for students enrolling in all forms of higher education; it is a particular danger in mass distance education or e-learning. There is ample evidence that distance<em>Â education and e-learning may not beÂ for everyone</em>. Most students (and actually all of us, faculty included)Â furthermore <em>overestimate</em>Â the time we have available, the resources we have access to, and of course, our ability to control (or think we control) our circumstances... Many students also overestimateÂ their ability to adjust to the different epistemologies and standards of higher education. Though this applies to most students, it is those students with a lack of social and cultural capital that are most probably more affected than others.</p>\n<p>Many (most?) distance education institutions think that students carry the main responsibility to ensure \"fitting in\". This is most probably why we talk so much about \"under-prepared students\" and never of an \"under-prepared\" institution...</p>\n<p>Higher education institutions have aÂ moral obligation to ensure that students <em>and</em> staff comprehend the unique challenges in studying through distance education and e-learning. We cannot assume that they (staff and students) know... The earlier staff and students know how they fit in, the better. The cost (direct and indirect) of enrolling through distance education and/or e-learning and onlyÂ then discover that \"it\" is not what you thought \"it\" was, is immense. The cost of employing staff who do not \"fit\" is even bigger â€“ because they may cause irreparable damage to students&apos; self-belief and potential, ruining lives, including their own.</p>\n<p>There are many possibilities that we can entertain without rolling out resource-intensive readiness assessments before students register. Some possibilities to address the notion of \"fit\" include</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Orientation programmes.</strong> Should \"orientation programmes\" (preferably online and assessed) not be made compulsory for <em>all</em> students planning to enrol in distance education and e-learning? I am not talking here about a \"wishy-washy-what-is-this-about\" voluntary course for students. The course should be designed to provide students a taste of studying through distance education and/or e-learningÂ <em>before</em>Â their registration is accepted.Â  I furthermore don&apos;t see any reason why prospective staff should not also be required to do this even before the selection committees sit to review their applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may ask â€“ \"But what about the cost of such orientation?\" Or, \"where do we find the time for determining whether staff and students \"fit\"? My counter questions are: \"Can we afford NOT to allow an opportunity for staff and students to determine their &apos;fit&apos;? How much time and resources can we actually save by creating a safe but critical space for staff and students to determine their &apos;fit&apos;?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Making the first four weeks of all courses open and free. </strong>This idea arose in a personal conversation with a colleague at Unisa (let&apos;s call him John) who suggested that we open up the materials of the first 4 weeks all courses for free, online. These are not watered down versions of the \"real thing\" but nothing more and nothing less than the first four weeks of the course. Students will then be able to assess whether there is a \"fit\" â€“ not only with regard to what they thought this course was about, but also with regard to the prescribed materials required, level of difficulty, nature and structure of the assignments, examination dates, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At present we are addressing the non-fit of students through extra tutorial letters, extra tutorial sessions (often face-to-face or via videoconferencing), providing teaching assistants and e-tutors at huge cost â€“ while the above may actually address the question of \"fit\" earlier, cheaper with less waste of resources for staff and students.</p>\n<p>In conclusion: Â Allowing students to determine whether they \"fit\" is in line with the drive to allow students to reach their potential and not exclude them, per se, because they don&apos;t meet institutional admission criteria. We should stop seeing and treating students as passive recipients of services, while they are actually <em>agents</em> making rational and irrational choices.

The point of discussion was to what extent opening resources in distance education is viable, achievable and desirable in a highly competitive higher education landscape. To what extent can we open up our materials under a Creative Commons Licence without losing our market advantage <em>or</em> our distinct value? How do we prevent private and for-profit higher education institutions from cannibalizing our open materials and \"stealing\" our market share? One proposal was to open <em>some</em> courses as a major PR exercise while defending our intellectual property rights and market share more than ever before.</p>\n<p>I was left perturbed and sad. Â What made my unease even more uncomfortable was the fact that I did not necessarily have the answers... Since the conversation I pondered, fretted, and struggled to make sense of, one the one hand, our dream and commitment to serve social justice by repositioning knowledge as a common good, and on the other hand, the perceived need to defend our turf and futures as knowledge producers/providers.</p>\n<p>Let me start at the beginning (or not quite...).</p>\n<p><em>Knowledge production and sharing had never been open.</em> Since time immemorial knowledge was shared only to those on the \"inside\", whether it was the tribe, the craft association, or the initiated in a particular religious setting. Â \"Having knowledge\" gave you a unique opportunity (above other individuals or tribes) of survival, or the after-life (if your were lucky). \"Having knowledge\" furthermore brought you power, respect and social standing in the community. (For a thought-provoking article on the functioning of literacy as social capital, see Carrington and Luke, 1997). With the advent of modern institutions such as universities and craft guilds, access to knowledge and expertise was defended and protected by means of strict admission requirements. Not only did these organisations protect various canons of knowledge, they also had the power to accredit, validate, or discredit new claims of knowledge. [Sounds familiar doesn&apos;t it?]</p>\n<p>Craft associations and guilds, whether the mask carvers in Benin or weavers in India, all had the same basis, namely the celebration and acknowledgement of expertise; exercising the monopoly on their craft in a particular geographical area; and regulating and sanctioning access to these specific expertise bases. Davenport and Prusak (2000), in discussing the measures taken to protect expertise, note that: \"Guilds protected their special knowledge; governments prohibited the export of economically important skills. France, for instance, made exporting lace-making expertise a capital crime: Anyone caught teaching the skill to foreigners could be put to death.\" (Also see Belfanti, 2004.)</p>\n<p>The history of \"academic\" scholastic inquiry and teaching shares many of the characteristics of knowledge production and control in the context of guilds. We often romanticize Greek and Roman communities of inquiry and academia, forgetting that admittance to these circles was based mainly on gender (one had to be male), being classified as indigenous (one had to be Greek) and citizenship (whether on the basis of property ownership or other criteria). (See the discussion of the development of education in Longstreet &amp; Shane 1993:4â€“7.)</p>\n<p>There is no evidence or examples of instances where the production and dissemination of knowledge were <em>not</em> controlled, regulated and legitimized, whether in the early Academy of Plato (385 BCE), the Buddhist Nalada University in Bihar, India (fifth century BCE), the University of Constantinople, established in 425 BCE, or the medieval madrasahs founded in the ninth century CE. Although the specific purpose and scope of these institutions differed and changed through the centuries, the definition of knowledge and the regulation of access to expertise were always controlled and in the service of the metanarratives of the time.</p>\n<p><em>So why would knowledge production in the 21<sup>st</sup> century be different?</em> How much chance does opening up knowledge sharing and accreditation have when for-profit education is dramatically on the increase? John Aubrey Douglas, in a post yesterday, 15 July, in the <a href=\"http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20120710160228719\">University World News</a>, states that \"... the 11 largest for-profit higher education companies,... experienced an increase in enrolments of over 30% between 2008 and 2010\". He continues: \"From 2000-10, the sector [for-profits] grew by some 235% in enrolment, increasing its market share from 3% to 9.1% of all tertiary enrolled students\". Â The number of new for-profit higher education institutions also grew â€“ \"In the five-year period beginning in 2005, a total of 483 new colleges and universities gained regional or national accreditation in the US. Of those new institutions, some 77% were for-profits, compared to only 4% public and 19% independent non-profit institutions\" (Douglas, 2012). In the United States, while the for-profit sector still only represent \"less than 10% of all enrolments, the for-profit sector currently accounts for 26.2% of all the post-secondary institutions\" (Douglas, 2012).</p>\n<p>So where does this leave opening up knowledge sharing in an increasingly competitive world?</p>\n<p>The above illustrates the immense need to open up knowledge sharing to those who will never be able to enrol in these for-profit institutions, or even public higher education institutions. Never before has the need to open education been greater. Higher education (both public and private) will increasingly fail those who were born poor and will stay poor (see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/15/will-hutton-social-mobility?CMP=twt_gu\">Will Hutton in the Observer, 15 July</a>), forever excluded from the hallowed halls of higher education.</p>\n<p>While it is relatively easy (and good for PR and brand building) for brick-and-mortar institutions to share knowledge in open forums, where does this leave distance education institutions whose value proposition, since its early days as correspondence education, was to make content available to students excluded from traditional education?Â  If the value proposition of distance education will no longer lie in \"making content available\", <em>what will be their value contribution</em>? Where does opening up content leave distance education providers in developing countries when private higher education institutions already cannibalize copyrighted materials?</p>\n<p>One option is to open <em>some</em> courses, and not even all of a course, as a PR exercise. In sustainability discourses many corporations are practising \"green washing\" â€“ where the public face of the corporation is one of green and sustainable practices, but beyond Boardroom doors, the hard figures of market share dictate. How many distance education providers will opt for an \"open washing\" â€“ enticing learners with so-called open courses and making some content freely available, but, behind Â closed doors, vigorously protect intellectual property rights and market share?</p>\n<p><strong>Â In closing:</strong></p>\n<p>Knowledge production has always served the powerful and dominant interest in society. Knowledge production and accreditation has never before in history been open.Â  <em>But never before in history has there been so many that have been (permanently) excluded from education.</em> Distance education has a choice â€“ we can \"open wash\" and be quoted in the PR wars, or we can realise that content production and sharing will no longer be a value proposition in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, whether we protect it or not. <em>It is time to think differently (and courageously) about the value we add...</em></p>\n<p>[Image retrieved from <a href=\"http://worldbetweenme.blogspot.com/2010/11/world-between-me-news_18.html\">http://worldbetweenme.blogspot.com/2010/11/world-between-me-news_18.html</a>, 16 July 2012]</p>\n<p><strong>Acknowledgement</strong></p>\n<p>Some parts of this blog were included in an article that was rejected but waiting to be revived&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>Belfanti, C.M.

Because Mars&apos;s tiny moon Phobos passed directly in front of the Sun, partially eclipsing it!&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"diigo-tags\">     tags:           <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/eclipse\">eclipse</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/mars\">mars</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/astronomy\">astronomy</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/magazine\">magazine</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"diigo-link\">        <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/lifehacks/2012/09/15/30-ways-save-1-minute-per-day/?awesm=tnw.to_n4Ng\">30 Ways to Save 1 Minute Per Day</a>   </p>\n<p class=\"diigo-description\">&#8220;30 ways you can save 1 minute every day&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"diigo-tags\">     tags:           <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/ways\">ways</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/minute\">minute</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"diigo-link\">        <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/gadgetbox/10-ways-android-beats-iphone-5-1B5919523\">10 ways Android beats the iPhone 5 &#8211; GadgetBox on NBCNews.com</a>   </p>\n<p class=\"diigo-description\">&#8220;In fact, even after Apple&apos;s johnny-come-lately improvements, Android phonesÂ have a number of key advantages over the iPhone 5.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"diigo-tags\">     tags:           <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/ways\">ways</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/android\">android</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/beats\">beats</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/iphone\">iphone</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/com\">com</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"diigo-link\">        <a href=\"http://smashinghub.com/open-source-apps-for-web-developers.htm\">9 Must Have Open Source Apps For Web Developers</a>   </p>\n<p class=\"diigo-description\">&#8220;A plethora of cool open source tools is available out there, but not all of them are up to the mark.

Just to make it clear, when I say games I refer to Â all kinds of games ( simulations, virtual world games , online games, computer games, puzzel games, video games and many more ). Several studies have proved that someÂ characteristicsÂ of games have a positive role in learning settings to the point that an entire new model of learning has seen the light under the name Digital Â Game-based Learning ( GBL ). We have already provided a detailed guide on GBL and in this posts we are adding some extra video tutorials to shed more light on this new trend.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"diigo-tags\">     tags:           <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/levelupbc\">levelupbc</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/tlchat\">tlchat</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/edchat\">edchat</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/gaming\">gaming</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/edtech\">edtech</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"diigo-link\">        <a href=\"http://www.middleweb.com/2847/how-to-build-happy-brains\">Brain Research: Adolescents Learn More in Cooperative Groups | MiddleWeb</a>   </p>\n<p class=\"diigo-description\">&#8220;We can help our middle grades students build happy, learning brains through interactive, interdependent group work.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"diigo-tags\">     tags:           <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/brain\">brain</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/research\">research</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/adolescents\">adolescents</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/cooperative\">cooperative</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/groups\">groups</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"diigo-link\">        <a href=\"http://www.edutopia.org/blog/film-festival-digital-citizenship\">Five-Minute Film Festival: Teaching Digital Citizenship | Edutopia</a>   </p>\n<p class=\"diigo-description\">&#8221; This playlist is intended to offer tools to make the case that it&#8217;s critical to teach this, and then launchpad videos to seed classroom discussions once you&#8217;ve carved out that precious time.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"diigo-tags\">     tags:           <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/film\">film</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/festival\">festival</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/teaching\">teaching</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/digital citizenship\">digital citizenship</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/citizenship\">citizenship</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/edutopia\">edutopia</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"diigo-link\">        <a href=\"http://resisttyranny.net/2012/09/15/infographic-the-political-spectrum-explained/\">Infographic â€“ The political spectrum explained | Resist Tyranny</a>   </p>\n<p class=\"diigo-description\">&#8220;Here&apos;s an interesting diagram that offers an explanation of the political spectrum.

Â I always hated those timewasters &#8211; find someone else wearing green underwear and introduce yourself. Â I&#8217;d rather find a like mind during the activity and build a more meaningful relationship that will continue after the session ends. Â The worst of the worst involves finding out what you had for breakfast using those clicking devices that almost always never work right the first time, making the whole process increasingly meaningless. Â Why not ask everyone to whip out their phone and enter responses online using any of the free services, using a technology that people are comfortable with? Â Or, as my computer studies students related to me after being frustrated with the software, just hold your hand up to vote.</p>\n<p>In my <a href=\"https://dougpete.wordpress.com/2012/09/14/an-interview-with-brenda-sherry-and-peter-skillen/\">interview</a> with Brenda Sherry and Peter Skillen a couple of days ago, I tried to get them to fully explain the <a href=\"http://mindsonmedia.ca/\">Minds on Media</a> concept for those who were interested in it. Â I think that Peter summed it nicely&#8230;.</p>\n<p><em>The concept grew somewhat organically â€“ except to say that we both have strong beliefs about several learning principles:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>the locus of control for learning should be in the hands of the learner</em></li>\n<li><em>the facilitator must be aware of, and respond to, the learner&apos;s desires, needs and expertise</em></li>\n<li><em>the learner should leave empowered to learn further â€“ beyond the MOM event</em></li>\n<li><em>there are always experts among us</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>So it made a lot of sense when we were organizing the ECOO conferences that we run a &apos;hands on&apos; day for people with these ideas in mind. But, we wanted more than their hands on â€“ we wanted their &apos;minds on&apos;.</em></p>\n<p>When you think through this, it is considerably different from a training session where the leader holds all the cards, er presentation slides, and walks you through the session.</p>\n<p>Later in the post, the topics available to participants for this year&#8217;s ECOO Minds on Media event are listed. Â You won&#8217;t find anything entitled &#8220;An Introduction to&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;Beginner&#8217;s Guide to&#8230;&#8221;. Â Instead the topics are all described using action words and honour the learning of those who would be participants. Â Having participated in Minds on Media in the past as both a facilitator and a pedagogista, I can tell you that sessions do not begin with the statement&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Today, you will learn how to &#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>By its nature, that statement presumes that the audience is a blank slate. Â While there are times that making that assumption is good, this isn&#8217;t one of them.</p>\n<p>Instead, teachers move around the room as free-range learners. Â They&#8217;re forever jumping into a discussion in process. Â The facilitator may pause and ask.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What about &#8230; will we learn today?&#8221;</p>\n<p>It honours both their role as facilitator/learner and the role of the teacher as learner. Â It cuts straight to the core so that active learning can begin.</p>\n<p>You need to experience it to complete understand.</p>\n<p>Registration for Minds on Media and, indeed, the entire ECOO Conference continues at <a href=\"http://www.ecoo.org\">http://www.ecoo.org</a>.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://dougpete.wordpress.com/2012/09/14/an-interview-with-brenda-sherry-and-peter-skillen/\" target=\"_blank\">An Interview with Brenda Sherry and Peter Skillen</a> (dougpete.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://dougpete.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/2012-ecoo-conference/\" target=\"_blank\">2012 ECOO Conference</a> (dougpete.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://dougpete.wordpress.com/2012/08/31/this-week-in-ontario-edublogs-30/\" target=\"_blank\">This Week in Ontario Edublogs</a> (dougpete.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://theconstructionzone.wordpress.com/2012/07/07/john-seely-brown-at-plp-live-and-ecoo12/\" target=\"_blank\">John Seely Brown at PLP Live and #ECOO12</a> (theconstructionzone.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://dougpete.wordpress.com/2012/08/10/look-for-it/\" target=\"_blank\">Look for it</a> (dougpete.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://nancy-rubin.com/2012/07/21/constructivism-and-online-learning/\" target=\"_blank\">Constructivism and Online Learning</a> (nancy-rubin.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://blog.markwcarbone.ca/2012/09/04/technology-enabled-learning-leadership-change-capacity-building/\" target=\"_blank\">Technology Enabled Learning: Leadership, Change, Capacity Building</a> (markwcarbone.ca)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://hastac.org/blogs/sglass/2012/09/01/learning-so-how-it-feels\" target=\"_blank\">Learning: So This Is How It Feels</a> (hastac.org)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://theconstructionzone.wordpress.com/2012/07/27/pbl-am-i-doing-it-right/\" target=\"_blank\">PBL?

The iPad 2 was released 11 months later, and the iPad 3 is currently rumored for a Spring 2012 release.

Â His answer made me smile &#8220;Just let your reputation open the doors for you&#8221;. Â Whatever you do, don&#8217;t say, &#8220;I&#8217;m here from the board office and I&#8217;m here to help you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I still remember that conversation. Â As I was assembling the interview <a href=\"http://dougpete.wordpress.com/2012/09/14/an-interview-with-brenda-sherry-and-peter-skillen/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> from yesterday, I was really struck by a comment from Brenda Sherry.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>When I&apos;m asked to coach in a school, for example, it&apos;s not really just me who visits but my whole network, as these are the resources (people and ideas) that I rely upon in order to maneuver effectively through the learning landscape of today&apos;s world.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">What an interesting and appropriate comment to read in the year 2012.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Ask anyone not in the teaching profession and it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll get the opinion that the teacher is the sole owner and dispenser of information and knowledge to students. Â I think it&#8217;s something to be expected.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">For the most part, we (just about anyone who reads this blog) graduated from a system where we expected that our teacher knew everything about the subject matter and our goal was to be able to learn 50% or more of it. Â The more we remembered and was able to pass back on an exam, the better the mark. Â To reinforce the concept, we attended college or university where our abilities to soak it all in was truly tested in classes of 2-300. Â In a way, I think that&#8217;s why some of the tenants of video learning are so popular. Â Watching a video of someone solve a mathematics or science problem reminds us of our classroom experiences &#8211; only better. Â We can replay the video many times until we understand.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Such an environment is far removed from the real classrooms in today&#8217;s schools. Â Even the notion that Brenda&#8217;s employer sees the need to hire a technology coach is confirmation that the classroom teacher can&#8217;t possibly know it all. Â In her interview, Brenda acknowledges that she doesn&#8217;t know it all but she sure knows where the resources lie. They lie in her network.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There may have been a time when collaboration meant working with the other teacher of the same subject. Â That&#8217;s not enough. Â Having that &#8220;whole network&#8221; of ideas, resources, colleagues, teams, dissenting opinions, links, like minds, &#8230; is priceless.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">In a district the size of Brenda&#8217;s, it&#8217;s unlikely that she&#8217;ll be able return toÂ that classroom working with teachers and students day after day. Â Yet, the true value will accrue to those who watch and listen when Brenda says &#8220;I have an idea from &#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;Let me connect you with &#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;I saw &#8230;&#8217;s ideas about this&#8221;. Â The true value lies in the connections.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">At this point in 2012, I think that Brenda has truly nailed it. Â If there&#8217;s one thing that she can leave behind after one of her visits, it&#8217;s that there&#8217;s a whole connected world just waiting to be accessed. Â You just need to make the connection.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I also hope that you, dear reader, are nodding your head as you think about her comment. Â A connected teacher is the most valuable asset that any system calling itself a 21st Century institution can have.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Are you connected? Â Are you connected enough? Â Are you one of the people who Brenda takes with her when she visits schools?</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://dougpete.wordpress.com/2012/09/14/an-interview-with-brenda-sherry-and-peter-skillen/\" target=\"_blank\">An Interview with Brenda Sherry and Peter Skillen</a> (dougpete.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://bloxhammarketing.com/2012/09/03/technology-in-my-ideal-school-the-marketers-perspective/\" target=\"_blank\">Technology in my ideal school &#8211; the marketer&#8217;s perspective</a> (bloxhammarketing.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://ed421.com/?p=2486\" target=\"_blank\">Connected Educator Month Day 25 &#8211; Pin all the things!

Â I&apos;ve worked with both of these wonderful people in recent years in a number of different contexts. Â My only regret has been that we didn&apos;t get to do more of it.</p>\n<p>Doug: Â Thank you, Brenda and Peter, for the opportunity to dig into your thoughts about education in Ontario and your insights into technology and how best to use it.</p>\n<p>In reading both your blogs over the years, I know that you mention great thinkers that have influenced your own thoughts. Â If I had to ask you to narrow it to just one, who would it be and why?</p>\n<p>Brenda: Oh boy. Â This is a difficult question for me because so many thinkers do influence me, including Peter who has been such a great colleague who pushes my thinking. Â I&#8217;d have to say <a href=\"http://stager.org/planetpapert.html\">Seymour Papert</a> and his concept of &#8216;constructionism&#8217; has definitely influenced my beliefs about how technology can best support learning in socio-constructivist environments. Â His views about the value of computational thinking led me to begin programming using <a href=\"http://www.microworlds.com/solutions/mwjunior.html\">MicroWorlds JR</a> in my Grade 1/2 class, and I think this continues to be an overlooked area in educational technology especially with the recent allure of web 2.0 tools. Â </p>\n<p>Peter: One?! Oh Doug. You&apos;re killing me! Â ;-) <a href=\"http://ikit.org/people/scardamalia.html\">Marlene Scardamalia</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://ikit.org/people/bereiter.html\">Carl Bereiter</a> (as a team) would have to rise to the top of my list. Their early (and continuing) work on &apos;knowledge construction&apos; and &apos;expertise&apos; has been instrumental in how I frame much of my learning, reading and everyday work. Back then &#8211; in the eighties &#8211; of course, when people spoke of collaborative construction of knowledge they were seen as a bit loony and the term &apos;knowledge co-construction&apos; was viewed as &apos;hoity toity&apos;. Now these concepts are de rigueur and everyone is using them. And with that comes the danger of &apos;lexical drift&apos; where they really lose their original meaning. I would also be remiss if I didn&apos;t acknowledge Brenda for her role in &apos;keeping me real&apos; and in her brilliance in operationalizing much that she and I think and talk about.</p>\n<p>Doug: Â A few years ago, the two of you were instrumental in rethinking what the ECOO (Educational Computing Organization of Ontario) conference might be. Â In fact, Brenda chaired the conference for a few years. Â In what direction do you feel you took the conference?</p>\n<p>Brenda: We were definitely observing Ontario teachers beginning to synthesize their knowledge of how people learn in the 21st century and the technologies that really leverage deeper learning. Â We wanted to share that capacity in a conference for teachers, by teachers. Â Our mission has been to inspire people with engaging speakers, to connect them through social media, and to focus on teachers as learners &#8211; regardless of their expertise with technology &#8211; and therefore we&#8217;ve called the conference Inspire. Connect. Learn. for several years now. Â Â Those three words really guide our planning. Â </p>\n<p>Peter: We wanted to move the conference from a focus on technology to a focus on &apos;learning&apos; and &apos;teaching&apos; enhanced by the affordances of technologies that have infused the lives of kids, teachers and society at large. It is no longer enough to speak about &apos;computers in education&apos; because, as we know, chips are integrated into so many devices and travel in our pockets. Wearable computers are on the horizon. So it is really important for us to think about these things as &apos;cognitive partners&apos; and to also help educators understand that and the &apos;other than cognitive&apos; impacts &#8211; the social restructuring of classroom and schools, media literacy, information, attention and mindfulness issues, etc.</p>\n<p>Doug: Â Where do you think that the conference needs to head in the future? Â Can a once a year conference do it or does the whole ECOO organization need a rethink?</p>\n<p>Peter: I like the format of the conference. I know it&apos;s cool to think &apos;unconference&apos;, &apos;conversations&apos;, &apos;co-construction&apos; and &apos;crowdsourcing&apos;. I, too, love these constructs and implementations. But, having said that, there are many times when people just love to &apos;sit and git&apos; &#8211; as I do when I watch a movie or a concert. I engage differently. I don&apos;t need to be backchanneling then.<br />\n Ok folks &#8211; lighten up! Don&apos;t dance on me because I am supporting that format. LOL I love all the other too! Goodness knows, I do enough of it. <img src=&apos;http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif&apos; alt=&apos;;-)&apos; class=&apos;wp-smiley&apos; /> In fact, I do enough to reflect deeply on the impact of these various forms of interactions &#8211; what works when and unintended effects and all.</p>\n<p>However, a single conference a year is not enough for ECOO to be doing. ECOO used to be much more. We had mini-conferences across the province. There were Special Interest Groups (SIGs) for elementary, Logo, secondary, etc. We had a journal &#8211; the ECOO Output that was distributed to members. We need to do more.</p>\n<p>Alas, it is a volunteer organization.</p>\n<p>Brenda: Â I think Ontario teachers love the chance to be f2f and connect in real-time. Â They keep connected after the fact using social media, but I&apos;d have to agree with Peter, once a year is definitely not enough, and networking on twitter provides a good start, but not a place where deeper conversations and sharing can happen. Â I hope that the future holds more opportunities for members to become involved in shorter term projects that they are passionate about (I&apos;m thinking subject/topic groups or one-day events here but there are likely many more) either in virtual or physical spaces. Â I&apos;d love for ECOO to be able to &apos;pull&apos; those creative ideas and folks into the fold and see what emerges!</p>\n<p>(read John Seely Brown&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.edgeperspectives.com/pop.html\">The Power of Pull</a> for more ideas on transforming organizations)</p>\n<p>Doug: Â In both your roles now, you see and support educators on a daily basis. Â Could you describe how you fill your days doing this?</p>\n<p>Brenda: Â I&apos;m a technology coach K-12 so I work with teachers who are new to using technology in their classrooms or who have students bringing in their own technology to class (sometimes assistive technology as well). Â Â My work involves helping teachers to begin with their learning goals and then choose technology that will support those goals and work well with the kinds of learners they have and their particular subject area. Â I&apos;m hoping to get some teachers connected within our board for discussion, action research and a celebration of effective technology use this year.</p>\n<p>Peter: Most of my work with educators these days is in online spaces &#8211; sometimes formally through the <a href=\"http://plpnetwork.com/\">Powerful Learning Practice</a> and <a href=\"http://otffeo.on.ca/\">Ontario Teachers&apos; Federation</a> and sometimes informally through social networks. In both cases, I am learning to use &apos;appreciative inquiry&apos; to draw out of the individuals what they want to learn and how they want to learn it. Then, it&apos;s my role to help them learn that. At the same time, I have my larger educational goals in mind &#8211; so it is always a balancing act satisfying both our goals.</p>\n<p>Doug: Â I&apos;ll put you on the spot. Â Who is needier? Â Brand new teachers from Faculties of Education or educators with some experience?</p>\n<p>Brenda: Tricky question all right! Â It&apos;s been my experience that regardless of whether they are new or experienced, teachers who are familiar with cooperative learning or more student-directed learning environments seems to embrace technology quickly as a way to get students collaborating, inviting in experts and unique resources, documenting their learning, and making thinking and discussion visible. Â Â Teachers who are unfamiliar with the shift that is happening towards learning communities where the teacher is there to &apos;facilitate&apos; learning (and learn along with students) rather than to be the transmitter of knowledge need more support. Â To me, that&apos;s not a question of technology knowledge, as much as a question about what makes 21st century pedagogy different &#8212; what needs to change &#8212; both brand new teachers and experienced teachers need to have lots of discussion about this.</p>\n<p>Peter: One of the &apos;myths&apos; that Brenda and I talk with people about is this: \"When young teachers join the profession, computers will be integrated effectively.\" The assumption is that they are &apos;digital natives&apos; and so are awesome with technology. Well, there are a couple of points to note. One is they may be great with &apos;socializing&apos; with computers a la Facebook or Instagram &#8211; but they do not likely have tons of skills related to using computers for cognitive gain or for computational reasons &#8211; like programming. (Now, I am not saying everybody needs to be a heavy-duty programmer &#8211; but, I do believe, as <a href=\"http://www.rushkoff.com/\">Rushkoff</a> states &apos;program or be programmed&apos;. And, as Brenda mentioned Seymour Papert and Logo (MicroWorlds) earlier, I will say that the ability to control the machine at that level allows teachers and students to &apos;tiptoe back through their thinking&apos; as they try to debug their programs.)</p>\n<p>The other point to note is that, as mentioned, it is not all about the technology. It is about a philosophy of learning and teaching. It is about how one perceives the world and how one situates oneself. Who is in charge of the learning? If you say, &apos;students should be in charge of their learning&apos;, then what do you mean by that? It needs to be unpacked and discussed. It requires that you look at scenarios and where power is located. For example, if students are to be in charge of their own learning can they choose not to do assignments or show up for class on time, and so on? Big questions of authority and self-determination.</p>\n<p>Doug: Â In the past year, both of you have become involved with the Powerful Learning Practice organization. Â That really promotes the concepts of connectivism. Â Do you find the principles consistent with your core beliefs?</p>\n<p>Brenda: Â Yes! Â Connectivism is at the heart of the way I do business these days and PLP does promote that. Â Â When I&apos;m asked to coach in a school, for example, it&apos;s not really just me who visits but my whole network, as these are the resources (people and ideas) that I rely upon in order to maneuver effectively through the learning landscape of today&apos;s world. Â One of my favourite quotes is by John Holt \"Learning is not the product of teaching. Â Learning is the product of the activity of learners\". Â I do believe that learning in groups can result in a synergy not present in individual settings, that learning is social, and that activity with others is a key part of building knowledge. Â Along with that comes a necessary balance of individual reflection&#8230;.but that&apos;s a whole new discussion!</p>\n<p>Peter: I agree that Powerful Learning Practice (PLP) promotes the concepts of connectivism. But, I also see that PLP blends a huge number of current and long-standing theories and practices including connectivism. This pot-pourri is extremely consistent with my beliefs. And, to be truthful, those who know me recognize that I would not be involved with an organization so deeply if that were not the case. <img src=&apos;http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif&apos; alt=&apos;;-)&apos; class=&apos;wp-smiley&apos; /> </p>\n<p>Now, do I agree with every detail of these theories? Clearly not. But that is the nature of being a critical thinker, isn&apos;t it? Finding dissonance in practice or theory is what leads to advancing new ideas and changing it up. There is no truth. There are only approximations. Maybe we are Â all TAs &#8211; Theory Approximators! Â LOL</p>\n<p>Doug: Â So, connectivism and constructivism can co-exist?</p>\n<p>Brenda: Â In my mind, yes, they can co-exist. Â Since I&apos;m a believer in Papert&apos;s &apos;constructionism&apos; (the act of creating artefacts that demonstrate knowledge) connectivism is a nice complement because it suggests that once knowledge has been articulated in some form (i.e. made public in some way&#8230;made its way out of your head, so to speak) then the ability to connect can enhance that knowledge either by building upon it, reflecting upon it, or through the discourse that might arise from it. Â I admit I did try to attend the MOOC that George Siemens and Stephen Downes held on Connectivism, but I&apos;m afraid that I need to make more time for it and try again to get a better handle on the theory of connectivism.</p>\n<p>Peter: In my mind, absolutely. But, then I think constructivism and behaviourism can co-exist. Â And that would be a stretch for most people. <img src=&apos;http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif&apos; alt=&apos;:-)&apos; class=&apos;wp-smiley&apos; /> But, here&apos;s my recent thinking on that one &#8211; backed up by some great new books*. Most of our day to day activities are carried out by each of us without conscious thought or even awareness &#8212; certainly not by an overt decision-making process. </p>\n<p>We couldn&apos;t possibly manage to get through the day if that were the case. Can you imagine the turmoil a centipede would have if she tried to think and decide which leg should be moved at which time. She&apos;d be tripping and falling all day long! So we run on auto-pilot. And, yes, of course we also make many decisions based on weighing alternatives. I get that. But, when one acknowledges the premise, then one is agreeing that automatized, behaviourist responses are integral to our every day living.</p>\n<p>Yet, on a different level, we are conscious, decision-making creatures with a soul, a heart, and a sense of self. So we can exercise our metacognitive skills in setting goals, generating alternative strategies and reflecting on our learning.</p>\n<p>Our minds, in this western society, tend to lean towards distinct categorization of the world around. It is the way we attempt to make sense of it. I understand that. It also leads us to parse the world in dichotomies &#8211; an &apos;on&apos; or &apos;off&apos;, a &apos;yes&apos; or &apos;no&apos;, kind of categorization. This, of course, has been amplified by our binary age of &apos;ones&apos; and &apos;zeroes&apos;. However, it is not necessary to think that my philosophy of education is &apos;constructivist or not&apos; or &apos;connectivist or not&apos;. The world is much more complex than that. It is a rich fabric of textured confusion which has many elements interwoven throughout &#8211; so I believe that there are elements of many theories that make up my educational philosophy. If you wish, read \"<a href=\"http://theconstructionzone.wordpress.com/2012/06/15/im-confused-thought-i-was-a-social-constructionist/\">I&apos;m Confused! I Thought I was a Social Constructionist!</a>\"</p>\n<p>Doug: Â The <a href=\"http://mindsonmedia.ca/\">Minds on Media </a>is a unique professional learning experience. Â I have been \"brought into the fold\" and have served both as a facilitator and a pedagogista. Â How did you develop the concept?</p>\n<p>Brenda: Â We have been so enriched by having you at our events Doug, thank you! Â Â </p>\n<p>After many years of participating in professional development, Â both as learners and facilitators, we started to talk about the fact that the method of professional learning (usually &apos;sit and git&apos; or not entirely responsive to the needs of the learners) didn&apos;t always match the kinds of shifts in practice that need to happen in a technology infused classroom. Â We thought that by experiencing an alternative that is learner driven, multi-modal, and somewhat &apos;flipped&apos; to give the learner control over resources and activities that fit their needs, teachers would appreciate a model for how that might look in the classroom. Â Indeed, we are NOT saying that a lecture-style presentation isn&apos;t excellent in certain cases and serves a purpose for learning that we all need and enjoy at one time or another&#8230;rather we are saying that there are alternatives and engaging teachers in this kind of learning themselves is a good place to start. Â </p>\n<p>Peter: Doug, we have been thrilled to have your expertise and mentorship in both those roles and as a friend and colleague. Thank you for that.</p>\n<p>The concept grew somewhat organically &#8211; except to say that we both have strong beliefs about several learning principles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the locus of control for learning should be in the hands of the learner</li>\n<li>the facilitator must be aware of, and respond to, the learner&apos;s desires, needs and expertise</li>\n<li>the learner should leave empowered to learn further &#8211; beyond the MOM event</li>\n<li>there are always experts among us</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So it made a lot of sense when we were organizing the ECOO conferences that we run a &apos;hands on&apos; day for people with these ideas in mind. But, we wanted more than their hands on &#8211; we wanted their &apos;minds on&apos;.</p>\n<p>Doug: Â Explain the role of the pedagogista for my readers please.</p>\n<p>Brenda: Â I&apos;ve always been interested in constructivist approaches, and a few years back <a href=\"http://stager.org/\">Gary Stager</a> recommended a book called <a href=\"http://www.reggiokids.com/about/hundred_languages.php\">The Hundred Languages of Children</a> which outlines the Reggio Emilia approach for early childhood education that began in Italy. Â One of the elements that stood out most for me was the emphasis that the schools put on teacher observation and reflection in understanding their learners. Â Â They value this so much in fact, that pedagogistas work alongside teachers in order to keep focused on pedagogy and to use observations to direct next steps with students &#8211; really a constantly evolving kind of formative assessment. Â It&apos;s easy, when teaching, to be caught up in the tasks of the moment related to lessons or the plan for the day. Â The pedagogistas bring a more metacognitive approach to the classroom and we thought it would be valuable to have that role during <a href=\"http://mindsonmedia.ca/\">Minds On Media</a> as well!</p>\n<p>Peter: I know Brenda will answer this one more &apos;correctly&apos; than I because of her greater familiarity with its roots. I take some liberty with the construct of &apos;pedagogista&apos;. <img src=&apos;http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif&apos; alt=&apos;:-)&apos; class=&apos;wp-smiley&apos; /> For Minds on Media, we felt it necessary to have one or two folks roaming around the space, listening in, being attuned for opportunities to be the &apos;metacognitive&apos; prompter! You know, when you are engrossed in learning a skill, it is sometimes difficult to &apos;zoom out&apos; and to see the bigger picture. The pedagogista can assist in that &apos;envisioning&apos; &#8211; that shifting of the lens so that the learner (teacher) can see their learning in a larger context. So the pedagogista might say, \"I see you are here at this centre asking questions that you have about this topic. How&apos;s that working for you compared to a sit &apos;n&apos; git session? I&apos;m wondering how you might see that occurring in your classroom.\" Or, \"You are doing interesting things with Google docs at this centre. Can you imagine ways this might enhance your students&apos; learning?\"</p>\n<p>Doug: Â From my experience, you have taken a very liberal approach to the word \"Media\"! Â What does \"Media\" mean to you in \"Minds on Media\"?</p>\n<p>Peter: Media, to me, are any artifacts of thought that are externalized. So written words, spoken words, typed words, paintings, sounds produced, and so on qualify as media as do the tools that produce them. Pretty liberal in some senses &#8211; but quite classic as well.</p>\n<p>Brenda: To me, media can mean tools and techniques as well as the activity of constructing messages. Â We vary the kinds of centres we have at Minds on Media; sometimes we are exploring ways to construct artefacts using technology (e.g., Scratch, logo, digital storytelling), sometimes we are exploring the use of tools to develop a different kind of community of learners (e.g., Edmodo, blogging, wikis, PLNs). Â You&apos;re right, we do use the term loosely, often based upon the passion of those who might be running a centre. Â I think we put more emphasis on the fact that we&apos;d like people to play with media &apos;mindfully&apos; &#8211; to be reflective, purposeful and playful in their approach to using media in the classroom.</p>\n<p>Doug: Â The next opportunity that educators have to experience a Minds on Media event will be a pre-conference for the ECOO conference. Â What sorts of things would a participant experience?</p>\n<p>Brenda: Â It&apos;s going to be a treat! Â Our theme is knowledge building so facilitators took that in a way that speaks to them, and we have the following centres this year:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Documenting Student Achievement with Aviva Dunsiger</li>\n<li>Using iPads for Knowledge Construction in the Learner-Centered Classroom with Colin Harris</li>\n<li>The Idea Hive Classroom Community: Students Sharing, Creating and Learning Together in Online Spaces with Heather Durnin</li>\n<li>Social Networking with Edmodo Â with Peter McAsh</li>\n<li>Making Thinking Transparent and Visible with Voicethread with Royan Lee</li>\n<li>Discover how to Create an Inclusive Classroom by Infusing Powerful Equity Messages</li>\n<li>Throughout your Day with Susan Watt and Trish Morgan</li>\n<li>Using Audio in the K-12 Classroom with Zoe Branigan-Pipe</li>\n<li>Special Education and Technology with Kim Gill</li>\n<li>Thinking and Creating with Melinda Kolk &#8211; Owner, Tech4Learning</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Peter: Brenda has named the centres we have this year so that is the tangible side. People will experience dissonance, control, frustration, deep learning, exhilaration and a sense of belonging to a community of like-minded educators.</p>\n<p>Doug: Â You have a brand new slate of facilitators for this round of Minds on Media at ECOO. Â How do you decide the topics and facilitators for the event?</p>\n<p>Peter: It&apos;s a challenge for us. Here&apos;s the deal. We have so many excellent educators in this province, it&apos;s been difficult since our firstÂ <a href=\"http://mindsonmedia.ca/\">Minds On Media</a>Â event. We started with a bunch of cool folks who really gelled at an OTF event. And there are so many great people &#8211; so it has been difficult. We just feel it needs to be changed up every now and so often to accommodate those whom Minds On Media serves.</p>\n<p>Brenda: It&apos;s usually a collaborative process based on the passion of the folks who would like to participate and the needs that we think might be out there. Â We decided on a whole new set of folks this year because we are interested in sharing the news about talented Ontario educators! Â There are so many teachers who are doing great things and we want to share out that expertise and connect ECOO participants to these wonderful educators.</p>\n<p>Doug: Â We&apos;ve discussed this many times so it comes as no surprise that I&apos;m a real supporter of this model for professional learning. Â Do you have a formula that a school district or other organization could use to facilitate a session of their own? Â Have you used it at UGDSB and the Toronto YM/YWCA? Â Have other districts used it?</p>\n<p>Brenda: Â <strong>Well, it&apos;s about honouring the expertise that already resides in your district, so we encourage folks to create their own sessions and celebrate their own educators. Â We do feel that there are some critical elements to making the day work well, and we share some of these at this site: <a href=\"http://mindsonmedia.ca/\">Minds on Media</a> Â Like most good learning environments, much of the preparation goes on in the background and before the day arrives. Â We hope that anyone who values the approach can feel free to take what we&apos;ve learned and try it out with their own spin to it! </strong></p>\n<p>Peter: As Brenda says, we are interested in helping people understand what has made it work and discussing how it can be better. Take the resources and thoughts and fly!</p>\n<p>Doug: Â Could I ask you to look at the images on your computer and share the best picture that you&apos;ve got that clearly illustrates what Minds on Media looks like and means for potential participants?</p>\n<p>Peter: I really have no pics of the events Doug. But, these represent it in some ways!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/1ZgIS0qALjXAy3E1-L3AcStmT--CgZW7i46bvt591ZGN0RDE1AJ8ftLgCe8QeI0GpackRZ5psyXYUfUjYPv5k4DeYt28Mu8zMcSWGWB6PeFFTAVdI3U\" alt=\"\" width=\"330px;\" height=\"401px;\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kH7g3UiWU2yo0_ji4nEWnw2mBlqReZXOGTPHDf_kKaaQ0wp9_f61rov8GBpTfDwicb3vBspdhkbhw5tDq4olW0oUEO0hmc2RYLTf0vZ0zajSXWQBs6I\" alt=\"\" width=\"414px;\" height=\"207px;\" /></p>\n<p>Brenda: Â This picture was taken when I was lucky to get a private tour of MIT&apos;s Media Lab from a grad student who happened to be wandering around while I was there early one Saturday morning a few years ago.

Â That&apos;s how I feel about Minds On Media &#8212; it&apos;s playful and creative and constructive (and also messy) &#8212; I love seeing teachers get excited about things that they make to take back to their classrooms! </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/mwjEY10EnVGsVFDScwhgBie4dMMacpDO2kq-nxhG0mE8hpu_TWhlA3SI4R3pSMgyPg-kvex24vGnWHMqZj4xrnouhIcndI_MMg_Hy_IZG-yIqaFyjPs\" alt=\"\" width=\"625px;\" height=\"415px;\" /></strong></p>\n<p>Doug: Â Thank you for your time and thoughts for this posting.

At the time, the only apps on the iPhone were the ones that came pre-installed (think stocks, calculator and YouTube). There were so few apps, they didn&apos;t even fill up the home screen! Apple didn&apos;t provide the ability to create or install any add-on apps. Instead, developers were urged to create web apps that users would access through the built-in Safari web browser.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"diigo-tags\">     tags:           <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/web\">web</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/web apps\">web apps</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/apps\">apps</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/will\">will</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/crush\">crush</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/native\">native</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"diigo-link\">        <a href=\"http://teacherstech.net/?p=2066\">12 Things Students Should Never Do on Social Media | Teachers Tech</a>   </p>\n<p class=\"diigo-description\">&#8220;We&apos;ve pinpointed 12 social media mistakes that students should avoid at all costs, because after all, it&apos;s never as simple as \"be responsible.\" And it&apos;s never as finite as \"don&apos;t friend your teacher on Facebook.\" Social media circumstances are nuanced and vary by situation, school and user.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"diigo-tags\">     tags:           <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/edtech\">edtech</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/facebook\">facebook</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"diigo-link\">        <a href=\"http://www.appolicious.com/education/articles/12704-appealing-apps-for-educators-screencasting-smackdown-videos-in-the-classroom\">Appealing Apps for Educators: Screencasting Smackdown â€“ Videos in the Classroom &#8211; iPhone app article &#8211; Jennie Magiera | Appolicious â„¢ iPhone and iPad App Directory</a>   </p>\n<p class=\"diigo-description\">&#8220;Video lessons have become the newest trend in education.

Â I did smile as I looked through the three page document just wondering how many people actually read it from beginning to end, understanding the content. Â I must admit losing interest after the third &#8220;party of the first part&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Why is this document so important?</p>\n<p>After all, when you think of how computers are populated with software, it goes something like this.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a technician or team of technicians sit down and install every piece of software to be used;</li>\n<li>this software is then configured with path names, server names, etc to create a &#8220;gold image&#8221;;</li>\n<li>the &#8220;gold image&#8221; is then deployed to however many hundreds or thousands of computers to be deployed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But, wait&#8230;.</p>\n<p>Every time you install a piece of software, there is a barrage of legalize that is part of the process. Â Everyone who installs software at home knows the procedure. Â Does anyone actually ever read it? Â And yet, you&#8217;ve clicked &#8220;I have read the terms and agree&#8221;. Â You have to. Â The software won&#8217;t install unless you do so.</p>\n<p>So, rewind back to the technician who installs a piece of software. Â She or he has agreed to the terms and conditions. Â The machine with the software is then passed along to the teacher in the classroom. Â The classroom teacher then passes it along to the students. Â In a perfect world, the student would have done the installation, read and understood the terms and conditions, and then begins. Â The reality here though is that someone else has done the agreement for them.</p>\n<p>In fact, I would suspect that nobody reads and understands the significance of the legal terms and conditions when you install a piece of software. Â I would then ask &#8211; why would you treat an Acceptable Use Policy any differently?</p>\n<p>Probably the only time I think through the legality of anything like this is with a Creative Commons License should I wish to use a picture from someone else for a particular purpose. Â Do I care more about the rights of a dude with a camera than I do when I purchase software from a large corporation? Â Or is it just an easier route?</p>\n<p>As I wade my way through the AUP, I came up with a hypothesis. Â The length of an AUP is inversely proportional to the seriousness of the content. Â How&#8217;s that for a thought?</p>\n<p>I put it in context to a manufacturing class. Â The teacher could spent the time doing all the teaching and heath &amp; safety content very academically by studying the manuals and the legislation. Â That&#8217;s not typically the approach because it&#8217;s not practical and experience has shown that it just plain doesn&#8217;t work. Â Instead, students are supervised when they&#8217;re using the equipment. Â They absolutely have to wear the safety equipment. Â They absolutely have to have a purpose when they&#8217;re using the machinery. Â For the most part, they respect the equipment and wouldn&#8217;t do something that would hurt a classmate.</p>\n<p>In fact, when you think about it, there&#8217;s no better way to create successful users of that machinery.</p>\n<p>Why can&#8217;t the same approach be taken with computer technology? Â Wouldn&#8217;t we create a better culture of digital citizenship?</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li

It seems the English-speaking world has embraced the concepts a lot better than the German-speaking &#8220;scene&#8221;.Â  But the main problem is: what to choose and where to stop?</p>\n<p>A nice problem - admittedly.. So right now there are at least three MOOCsÂ  I find really interesting and worth spending my time on. And then there is the <a href=\"http://colearncamp.hessenmetall.de/\" title=\"colearncamp\" target=\"_blank\">colearncamp</a> (German) in Frankfurt coming up at the end of this month! The colearn, or Corporate Learning, Camp has ~90 participants registered for each of the 2 days. That looks like an interesting Saturday <img src=&apos;http://specialtrees.net/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif&apos; alt=&apos;:)&apos; class=&apos;wp-smiley&apos; /> But back to the three MOOCs..</p>\n<p>First of all: what is a MOOC? MOOC stands for Massive Open Online Course. Just recently I looked at the usability, accessibility and UX of a widely advertised MOOC, the <a href=\"https://6002x.mitx.mit.edu/\" title=\"mitx6002\" target=\"_blank\">MITx course on Circuits&amp;Electronics</a>. I presented <a href=\"http://ocs.aishe.org/index.php/international/2012/schedConf/presentations\" title=\"mitxpaper\" target=\"_blank\">the results</a> at <a href=\"http://ocs.aishe.org/index.php/international/2012/index\" title=\"aishe-c\" target=\"_blank\">AISHE-C</a> . Over 150&#8242;000 people from around the world had signed up for the MITx course - that certainly makes it Massive. It is online and still open for guest users and it was free all along - that makes it online (first O) and sort of open (2nd O). Actually, as a registered user it was even possible to download the textbook. So, yes, open it was/is. And it had a course structure - actually very much so. So there you have it: Massive, Online, Open and a Course. It allows for the massive student population to learn and discuss - MITx provided a Wiki for that. Impressive speed: no matter what time of day, questions would receive at least 1 answer within minutes. There was always someone awake and logged in.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mobimooc.wikispaces.com/a+MobiMOOC+hello!\" title=\"mobimooc\" target=\"_blank\">MobiMOOC</a> started on Saturday. The topic list is as long as it is impressive: global impact of mobile devices, mobile learning curriculum framework, mLearning for development, train-the-trainer, corporate learning, mobile activism in education, augmented learning, mLearning pedagogy and theory, mobile gaming,Â  mobile health (mHealth) and a collaborative exchange on mLearning tools. Should be interesting to see how that will fit into 3 weeks. They have a <a href=\"http://mobimooc.wikispaces.com/timing\" title=\"mobimooctimes\" target=\"_blank\">schedule</a> outlined - unfortunatley I missed the first 2 webinars, both scheduled yesterday. But no problem, I can watch them later on.</p>\n<p>Yesterday was the start of oped12 - <a href=\"http://open.mooc.ca/\" title=\"oped12\" target=\"_blank\">Openness in Education</a>, a MOOC on, well, the title really gives it away. I received the first Daily, followed the instructions and registered this blog. So you will find more about oped here over the coming weeks. It is the longest course; it runs for 12 weeks until the end of November. I just went back and checked -loads of other blogs registered already!! I am really looking forward to what and how people share.</p>\n<p>And last, but not least, the <a href=\"http://edfuture.net/blog1/course-topics/\" title=\"CFHE12\" target=\"_blank\">CFHE12-MOOC</a> on Current/Future State of Higher Education. The course starts 8 October and runs for 6 weeks until mid-November. I am particularly interested in the topics in week 2, Net pedagogies: New models of teaching and learning, week 4, Big data and Analytics and the topic in week 6, Distributed Research: new models of inquiry.

It might also give you some ideas and helps to define your own study area. In most cases you won&#8217;t get a pass for repeating work that has been published already; so doing a thorough literature review helps you avoid that trap. A literature review should inform your research question, but if you do it well it will actually give you your research question.</p>\n<p><strong>An outline of what a literature review is</strong>, what to do for preliminary research, how to analyze the literature and finally some information on structure and writing has been put together into a short paper on <a href=\"http://www.specialtrees.net/Writing%20a%20Literature%20Review.pdf\" title=\"LitRev\" target=\"_blank\">Writing a Literature Review</a> by my colleague Dr Aoife MacCormac from <a href=\"http://www.bdi.ie/\" title=\"BDI\" target=\"_blank\">BDI</a>.

How long-term is your contribution, given the anticipated future developments in X?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">15. What did you do for your MPhil, and how does your PhD extend it? Did you make any changes to the system you implemented for your MPhil?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">16. What are the strongest/weakest parts of your work?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">17. Where did you go wrong?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">18. Why have you done it this way? You need to justify your approach - don&#8217;t assume the examiners share your views.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">19. What are the alternatives to your approach?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">20. What do you gain by your approach?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">21. What would you gain by approach X?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">22. Why didn&#8217;t you do it this way (the way everyone else does it)? This requires having done extensive reading. Be honest if you never thought of the alternative they&#8217;re suggesting, or if you just didn&#8217;t get around to it. If you try to bluff your way out, they&#8217;ll trap you in your own words.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">23. Looking back, what might you have done differently? This requires a thoughtful answer, whilst defending what you did at the time.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">24. How do scientists/philosophers carry out experiments?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">25. How have you evaluated your work?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">26. Intrinsic evaluation: how have you demonstrated that it works, and how well it performs?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">27. Extrinsic evaluation: how have you demonstrated its usefulness for a specific application context?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">28. What do your results mean?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">29. How would your system cope with bigger examples? Does it scale up? This is especially important if you have only run your system on `toy&#8217; examples, and they think it has `learned its test-data&#8217;.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">30. How do you know that your algorithm/rules are correct?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">31. How could you improve your work?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">32. What are the motivations for your research? Why is the problem you have tackled worth tackling?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">33. What is the relevance of your contributions? To other researchers? To industry?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">34. What is the implication of your work in your area? What does it change?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">35. How do/would you cope with known problems in your field? (e.g. combinatorial explosion)</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">36. Have you solved the field&#8217;s problem that you claim to have solved? For example, if something is too slow, and you can make it go faster - how much increase in speed is needed for the applications you claim to support?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">37. Is your field going in the right direction? For example, if everyone&#8217;s been concentrating on speed, but the real issue is space (if the issue is time, you can just wait it out (unless it&#8217;s combinatorially explosive), but if the issue is space, the system could fall over). This is kind of justifying why you have gone into the field you&#8217;re working in.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">38. Who are your envisioned users? What use would your work be in situation X?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">39. How do your contributions generalise?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">40. To what extent would they generalise to systems other than the one you&#8217;ve worked on?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">41. Under what circumstances would your approach be useable? (Again, does it scale up?)</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">42. Where will you publish your work? Think about which journals and conferences your research would best suit. Just as popular musicians promote their latest albums by releasing singles and going on tour, you should promote your thesis by publishing papers in journals and presenting them at conferences. This takes your work to a much wider audience; this is how academics establish themselves.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">43. Which aspects of your thesis could be published?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">44. What have you learned from the process of doing your PhD? Remember that the aim of the PhD process is to train you to be a fully professional researcher - passing your PhD means that you know the state of the art in your area and the directions in which it could be extended, and that you have proved you are capable of making such extensions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">45. Where did your research-project come from? How did your research-questions emerge? You can&#8217;t just say &#8220;my supervisor told me to do it&#8221; - if this is the case, you need to talk it over with your supervisor before the viva. Think out a succinct answer (2 to 5 minutes).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt 18pt; text-indent: -18pt\">46. Has your view of your research topic changed during the course of the research?</p>\n<p>47. You discuss future work in your conclusion chapter. How long would it take to implement X, and what are the likely problems you envisage? Do not underestimate the time and the difficulties - you might be talking about your own resubmission-order! <img src=&apos;http://specialtrees.net/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif&apos; alt=&apos;;-)&apos; class=&apos;wp-smiley&apos; /> </p>\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(179,0,0,'To ethnography or not to ethnography','text/html','http://specialtrees.net/wordpress/?p=61','Research',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,17,'\nEthnographic research in information systems research is not new, but what is it?\nIt is a very in-depth research method and a way of describing the real world.

class=\"MsoNormal\">It is a very in-depth research method and a way of describing the real world. The researcher usually spends several months \"in the field\", in this research area the field usually is a company. Typically the researchers immerse themselves in the life of the people they study. It has been used to investigate social and organizational contexts of information systems.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In ethnography data is collected through interviews, documentary evidence, participant observation and informal social contact.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Benefits</strong> of ethnographic research are the in-depth understanding of people, organization and context of work. The researcher sees what people are doing and hears what they are saying. This enables the researcher to question what is taken for granted. For example people might have the perception that they follow a certain process, while observation might unveil they are following a completely different process or none at all. Your observation might cause you to question what standard and best practice is and it unravels the actual practice.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Disadvantages</strong> of ethnographic research are that the data collection and the analysis process is long. The research has a narrow focus, as it concentrates on one company.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For the researcher this means it is important to think about what are the parameters which make the company comparable to others and are these parameters relevant for the findings. However, if it is valid to generalize from case study research, it is similarly valid to apply this principle here.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I am preparing ethnographic research to explore requirements for a software engineering framework. So I read a bit about it and talked to some ethnographic experts I know.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After talking to people who have done ethnographic studies in information systems research, I came up with the following <strong>list of issues to consider</strong>:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\" style=\"text-indent: -18pt\">1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Get involved, get a job to do in the company that is of use to the people you are observing</p>\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"text-indent: -18pt\">2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Follow one project from the beginning as far as your timeline allows</p>\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"text-indent: -18pt\">3.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Introduce an observation instrument from the beginning:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin-left: 54pt; text-indent: -18pt\">Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Keep a diary; write Â½ hour at the end of each day</p>\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin-left: 54pt; text-indent: -18pt\">Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Analyze and then follow the structure after the 1<sup>st</sup> week<br />\nWrite about people, profiles, tasks, projects</p>\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin-left: 54pt; text-indent: -18pt\">Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Collect data so it suits your research; have a plan!</p>\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin-left: 54pt; text-indent: -18pt\">Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Interviews should be written up at the same day with at least a brief summary - if there is a recording.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin-left: 54pt; text-indent: -18pt\">Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Regularly review your ideas and develop ideas; write analytic memos</p>\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"text-indent: -18pt\">4.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Organize a workshop and report what you found or saw</p>\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin-left: 54pt; text-indent: -18pt\">Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A happened like that</p>\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin-left: 54pt; text-indent: -18pt\">Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  B happened like that</p>\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin-left: 54pt; text-indent: -18pt\">Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Then ask:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin-left: 90pt; text-indent: -18pt\">a.Â Â Â Â Â Â  What is best for you? (ask people in the company)</p>\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin-left: 54pt; text-indent: -18pt\">Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Ask yourself:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin-left: 90pt; text-indent: -18pt\">a.Â Â Â Â Â Â  What are the parameters to consider?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin-left: 54pt; text-indent: -18pt\">Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Come up with a prototype process together with the people involved</p>\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpLast\" style=\"margin-left: 54pt; text-indent: -18pt\">Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Be prepared that people might not like what you report back</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Some things to consider: things written in your diary might be without much reflection, just to document them and you will know that, but someone else reading it might be upset.</p>\n<p><strong>Reporting your findings</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">To report the findings, methods of participatory design have been used.

Yesterday I had the women write another test and, as expected, Aisha and Sara had by far the best results. But all of them did well. I hope Caroline will be able to continue the teaching; I left her most of my books and some ideas on how to continue. I hope the book I ordered for her will be helpful. These women really want to learn and they, do if they are given the chance.<br />\nI&#8217;m also glad Johnson took me on a trip to a small mountain village two days ago. The local secondary school will have students from an American school visiting next week. The best students were selected to host the American kids and we went with the teacher to visit the homes and to see what might be needed. I know, this is a worn out expression, but it did almost break my heart how some of them live and I&#8217;m full of respect that they are still the top students. One boy shares his home with his 90 year old grandfather, which means after school he takes care of everything. They live in a mud house without water and electricity. Another student, who is also an orphan, lives with her aunt, who has several children of her own, was left by her husband and on top of everything else has had breast cancer for the last 3 years. It seems she is in the terminal stage. I really hope that some of the American kids will keep in touch and that a few scholarships for those in worst circumstances come out of this. Having said all that, we also visited families, living in a nice house (however, without electricity), with parents who will do anything to help their children to make it through school. It was wonderful to see how neighbours or relatives take on the challenge and become guardians, despite their own difficult living conditions.<br />\nI will have to write about Margaret and children of destiny in a later posting. An extraordinary woman, taking care of very special children, orphans between 4 and 18 years of age.<br />\nOn a more trivial note: I won&#8217;t eat chicken for a while and although I like it, I have also had enough avocados for a while&#8230; Not being able to eat tomatoes, sugar and beef turned out to be a real challenge.

I thought Salmin, the driver, could show us some of the sites. Well, it turned out he couldn&#8217;t and Msafiri saved the day: we called him, he called a guide he knew in Marangu and we were sorted;) We spent the day leisurely walking, listening to explanations about plants, buildings and history - from 9am until 5pm. It was quite the day! We saw stone potatoes, coffee trees, of course some avocado trees and the traditional grass hut of the Chagga - it used to house the whole family, a cow, food for the animal and humans and a place to cook. The Kilimanjaro Resort in Marangu was the stop after our lunch - a place I can definitely recommend.<br />\nRose and Santa Maria - 23/24 May<br />\nMonday was a very normal day - teaching, going into town to find out about the bus to Dar on Wednesday - had to come back on Tuesday, because tickets are only sold one day in advance. I briefly talked to Caroline who had visited Sally on Sunday - I had assumed that Sally would go home for the weekend just like the strudents at St Jude. It seems she has settled in alright and has made a friend already who shared a few things she was missing - she just needed washing powder, flip flops and the snacks are a bit more expensive as we thought. So I got those things on Monday and gave it to Caroline, who will visit Sally either this week or at the weekend.<br />\nTuesday I started teaching, the women started showing up, I explained something and while the women were copying it down I walked around the building. And who would I run into but Rose? She has a slightly tense relationship with Foot2Africa - to put it mildly. But that day she was all sweet - she asked about the class, she even sat in for a while and then she invited Olga and me for tea and a samosa. Well, I will not write more about this. It was a nice gesture, although a bit bizarre. I left the women with a big homework as I wouldn&#8217;t be back before Monday.<br />\nThere was one thing to do: I had promised Aisha, one of the Rudisha women, we would walk to a nearby school together to investigate about the conditions and requirements to get into the school. Aisha has four children, two of which are currently not attending school, because she cannot afford to pay for secondary school, which is considersbly more expensive than primary school. The younger daughter just finished primary school last December, while her oldest daughter finished primary school in 2008 and has stayed home since, helping around the house. Santa Maria is a school run by catholic nuns and a 10 minute walk from Rudisha&#8217;s workshop. It is a school similar to Mount Kilimanjaro School, slightly less expensive, also with a high standard, but it requires students to pass an entrance exam. They will not accept students who have been out of school for longer than 1 year - which means Aisha&#8217;s older daughter cannot get in, while the younger daughter will now sit the entrance exam in October. Aisha has signed her up for tutoring to prepare for the tough exam. If she passes successfully she will need a sponsor/mentor. If you are interested - please get in touch with me. I am looking for someone interested in supporting a child through the six years of secondary school, which costs approximately 700â‚¬ per year, and who is also interested in taking some interest in the progress and provide some mentoring: give positive feedback, provide encouragement when things are getting more difficult and, depending on how things develop, help in a few years with finding information about university or vocational training.</p>\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(184,0,0,'St Jude&#8217;s Revisited','text/html','http://specialtrees.net/wordpress/?p=56','Tanzania',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,17,'At first we went to the Usa River campus.

We traveled across town and 45 minutes later we reached our destination.<br />\nAt first I thought, this is all a bit too polished - the visitor service, the assembly with students performing (for the visitors?). But now, more than a week later I still like to remember the visit. And I have a lot of good memories. The guests were invited up on a stage to briefly introduce themselves, so the students knew our names. During the tour with Adellah from the visitor service, a little girl about Sally&#8217;s age came up to me and said &#8220;Hello Sabine&#8221; - I was very surprised she remembered my name. Turns out we share the<br />\nsame name;)</p>\n<p>A few minutes later we passed a room with the dance club in action - practicing what I know as Ententanz, and before we knew it, Deb and I were dancing as well. The rooms are all organized practical - practical for the students and in friendly colors so it can be fun to be there. Each student has a space in the shelf for the bags and some space in a large shelf for text books and exercise books.<br />\nThe grounds are divided into separate areas for lower and upper primary and the respective playgrounds reflect the different age groups. Similarly the colorful murals encompassing the school grounds are showing learning content from the syllabus. A great way to learn - apparently teachers use the large pictures, which are done in excellent detail, to explain for example the reproductive organs or the digestive tract of humans or some physical phenomenon.<br />\nWhat I still remember most though is the enthusiasm for kitchen staff and teachers alike, a lot of things that show attention to detail and the love of all the staff of St Jude&#8217;s for these children: children who fail a class can repeat and so far this hasn&#8217;t been much of a problem; if the teachers notice that the students are more upset than to be expected before going back home for the holiday, a group of 2-3 teachers will visit the family and talk to the neighbours again. Sometimes students know they won&#8217;t get more than 1 meal per day at most - that certainly would upset me as well. In such cases the school takes in lower primary students for boarding. Usually boarding is only from upper primary to give the students the chance to build a relationship with their family and, how Adellah put it, so they know where their home is.<br />\nThe school has a computer room which has very restrictive internet settings for afternoon classes and no internet access in the morning, but the computer labs are equipped with state of the art hardware - in other words, the children really learn to use a computer as a helpful tool.<br />\nSt Jude&#8217;s is teaching the syllabus for the international baccaleaureate - so in theory the graduates can study in most places worldwide. The first graduates are not expected for another two years, but then the next challenge is waiting: to find scholarships for these bright and highly motivated children.

However, a $60 million dollar investment <sup class=&apos;footnote&apos;><a href=&apos;#fn-1-2&apos; id=&apos;fnref-1-2&apos; onclick=&apos;return fdfootnote_show(1)&apos;>2</a></sup>Â Â suggests other motivations.</p>\n<p>Harvard have stated that they believe their face to face courses will benefit from the online offering. This is partly a marketing stance, people pay handsomely to attend Harvard, however since the on-campus students have access to the new materials and new platform, there is clearly something in this.Â More and more teaching is blended these days: few face to face courses lack some kind of online support and many teachers use online interaction to extend engagement with topics beyond face to face sessions.</p>\n<p>Beyond this, large student numbers brings a mass of data on all manner of things, from pedagogy and instructional design to marketing. As Phil Bradley observed of Google: if you&#8217;re not paying for the product, you are the product.Â MIT and Harvard are oversubscribed but their recommendation to other education providers could be invaluable. Other HEIs might use the courses as gateway qualifications for admissions.

Interesting emphasis on supporting digital pedagogy rather than setting up expensive infrastructure, which nobody was suggesting anyway.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;One of the greatest changes can be seen in the lives of children and young people, who are at ease with the world of technology and who communicate, socialise and participate online effortlessly. Two-thirds of five- to seven-year-olds use the internet at home, rising to 82 per cent for 8- to 11-year-olds and 90 per cent for 12- to 15-year-olds. Over a third of 12- to 15-year-olds own a smartphone, and typically use the internet for 15.6 hours every week. Children are increasingly embracing technology at a younger age: for example, 23 per cent of five- to seven-year-olds now use social networking sites.&#8221; &#8220;Yet the classrooms of today don&#8217;t reflect these changes. Indeed, many of our classrooms would be very recognisable to someone from a century ago. While there has been significant investment in technology in education, it has certainly not transformed the way that education is delivered.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;Part of the problem has been that investment has focused on hardware. My fear is that, in the past, too much emphasis has been placed on machines that quickly become obsolete, rather than on training individuals to be technologically as literate and adept as they need to be. What&#8217;s more, fixating on expensive, soon-to-be out-of-date kit represents a failure to understand the fundamental changes taking place&#8221;.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;One major change concerns content. Technology is having a huge impact on the way educational material can be delivered. iTunesU now gives everybody access to the world&#8217;s best lectures. The Khan Academy provides 2700 high-quality micro tutorials on the web, so that anyone, anywhere can access them for free. Brilliant scientific publications like Science are building their own ecosystems of educational content. And by definition, as we move to a world where we expect every child will have a tablet, the nature and range and type of content that can be delivered will be all the greater&#8221;.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;Educational gaming, for example, is a booming area &#8211; and ripe for even further development. Games developed by Marcus Du Sautoy, Professor of Mathematics at Oxford, are helping children engage with complex maths problems that would hitherto have been thought too advanced. And the Department for Education is currently working with the Li Ka Shing Foundation and the highly respected Stanford Research Institute on a pilot programme to use computer programmes to teach maths. We have not developed the programme &#8211; we are just helping them run a pilot. Stanford say it is one of the most successful educational projects they have seen&#8221;.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;These exciting advances are the sort of thing that a central government department could never hope to produce and maintain. And nor should it seek to: Whitehall must enable these innovations but not attempt to micromanage them. Such content is being created daily, and the vast majority is free to anyone with an internet connection. Our role is to help bring schools and these developments together.&#8221; &#8220;To be absolutely clear: this isn&#8217;t about replacing teachers with YouTube videos &#8211; of course it isn&#8217;t. But it would be negligent of us not to look at how we can harness these developments for the benefit of all pupils. In Singapore, for example, I was lucky enough to witness how a superb lesson can be delivered through a mixture of online and teacher-led instruction. We can do it here too &#8211; and in the coming months we&#8217;ll be setting out how.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;Another way in which technology is changing education is through its potential to create sharper assessment systems. Computer lab management software is now so sophisticated that an individual teacher can monitor how each student is doing simultaneously and then &#8211; without singling out that child in front of others &#8211; provide them with the direct amount of support that they need, accelerating the rate at which some children can learn and providing additional help for others. Problems can be picked up earlier. Students can be stretched when they&#8217;re ready. It&#8217;s the next step towards truly personalised learning &#8211; and it will also enable parents to have a better understanding of the level at which their children are operating.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;Thirdly, technological advances can have a huge impact on teacher training. Teachers can more easily observe other teachers and learn more about the craft. Professional development content can be delivered in more accessible, engaging, and cost effective ways. Individual teachers can use the latest developments to refine their lessons to precision. As Michael Nielsen points out in his excellent new book, &#8216;Reinventing Discovery&#8217;, new developments allow teachers to get better feedback about how their lessons are being received. So not only does the spread of innovations like the Khan Academy mean there is more great teaching material on the web, but new tools like Google Analytics allow anyone to analyse video for attention, second-by-second, in a way that used to be very expensive and complex. All these are welcome developments.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;Of course, in stressing the importance of digital content, I&#8217;m not saying we should neglect hardware altogether &#8211; far from it. But hardware means more than just the latest desktop &#8211; especially when many pupils are increasingly likely to have access to superior technology at home &#8211; or even in their pockets &#8211; than in their school&#8217;s computer lab. That&#8217;s why we need to think about how to give more children the chance to engage with truly cutting edge hardware, like 3D printers, or learn the fundamentals of programming with their own single-board computers, like the Raspberry Pi.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;The challenge for us is this: how we can harness the many exciting technological leaps that are constantly being made? We will be saying much more early in the new year. Make no mistake: this is a priority for me. I believe we need to take a serious, intelligent approach to educational technology if our children are not to be left behind. As John Chubb and Terry Moe put it in their excellent book on the subject, a genuine engagement with the wondrous world of technological innovation will see children&#8217;s learning &#8216;liberated from the dead hand of the past.&#8217; We owe it to pupils across the country to take this issue seriously.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Source: http://www.education.gov.uk/inthenews/speeches/a00200484/michael-gove-speaks-to-the-schools-network</p>\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(189,0,0,'Blackboard 9.1 learning modules','text/html','http://pauljinks.co.uk/?p=71&#038;utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=blackboard-9-1-learning-modules','Uncategorized',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,18,'I like learning modules for distance learning.

The personal commitment required to join such processes is reduced slightly (it was always possible to buy a book and wear a t-shirt after all), but the connections to other people, though superficial and ephemeral for most are far easier to establish. Twitter exemplifies this. Ultimately what matters will be what lasts, for us as individuals and for the world at large, what is difficult is to know what this will be. The future is unwritten.

Tutors can grade the wiki and give feedback, though with nothing like the facility afforded by Turnitin.<br />\nOn the other hand, students can&#8217;t easily extract their work in the wiki, for example to add to a portfolio or to refer to later. Nor can it be exported to other platforms or submitted to Turnitin.</li>\n<li><strong>File exchange</strong><br />\nStudents can upload files to a repository area to share. These can be given a title, but not a description or explanatory notes. May be useful, who knows.</li>\n<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>Â - which means Virtual Classroom and Chat.<br />\nAwful. Why anyone would use these in a world containing Skype and MSN escapes me. Maybe because they don&#8217;t want the other students to have their msn ID?</li>\n<li><strong>Group Blog/Group JournalÂ </strong><br />\nNot sure what the difference here is. In both blogs and journals entries can be posted/edited by anyone in the group; in both there are comments/discussions for each blog post. The journal looks like it&#8217;s written on a piece of lined paper torn from a spiral bound notepad. Outside of the group spaces journals are private to the student and instructor, maybe this can be turned on within the group setting so students can reflect on how they&#8217;re finding the collaborative process.</li>\n<li><strong>Group discussion board</strong><br />\nHaven&#8217;t looked closely at this. A normal Bb discussion board I believe.</li>\n<li><strong>Group tasks</strong><br />\nVery basic task manager. You can set tasks, give priority and deadlines. Maybe in the descriptions you might assign tasks to individuals? I kind of like it, based on a recent study experience where my group muddled through to no particular success and a rival group set and assigned tasks to win kudos. Mind you, they used a wiki to do it, which might be a more transparent way of going about it at least in the initial phases.</li>\n<li><strong>Group Homepage</strong><br />\nYou can add widgets &#8211; sorry, modules. I enjoyed adding the school Twitter feed to ours and links to Library resources.</li>\n<li><strong>Customise Group Banner/Colour</strong><br />\nSome students will really enjoy doing this in the first 10 minutes in the Group space.</li>\n</ol>\nHope to spend some time in the space and test drive some of the features in more depth. So far, not seeing anything that screams &#8216;no&#8217;.

Identifying names/details have been removed or changed.</p>\n<p><strong>Group size<br />\n</strong>Other participants have reflected that a group of 9 is too big. I agree; it&#8217;s difficult to engage with 8 other individuals in a face to face setting where you&#8217;ve spent a little time with &#8216;getting to know you&#8217; activities. A group of 5-7 would probably work better, allowing a large enough group to complete the task collaboratively if a couple of people drop out.</p>\n<p><strong>Peer support<br />\n</strong>Some students have mentioned that they kept working because they felt some commitment to the other people in their group; as designers of online learning we should foster this kind of support and engagement rather than letting it happen.</p>\n<p><strong>Time given for the task</strong><br />\nA week seems like quite a short period in which to do the task. Not because the task was very onerous, but because it&#8217;s online and therefore collaboration takes longer. Also, if you&#8217;re having a particularly difficult week at work or at home, you run the risk of missing the whole thing. If this task had been assessed, this would have been a major headache. I don&#8217;t think this is a criticism of this course because it&#8217;s very short.</p>\n<p>Other online courses I&#8217;ve taken have allowed a couple of weeks for group work and make sure that the first task is well structured with clear instructions and support from the tutor. Second time round is much easier because everyone knows what they&#8217;re doing. The problem is, if the first time round goes wrong, students may not stick around. Another approach is to have individual tasks running concurrently with group work so that the group work can be given longer.</p>\n<p><strong>Roles</strong><br />\nI shouldn&#8217;t really comment on this since I missed the online tutorial. However, my opinion based on no experience is that having different roles for group work which people assign to themselves/each other is an interesting idea. That said, in situations where you don&#8217;t really know who you&#8217;re dealing with or the exact nature of the task, it can add an unwelcome layer of complexity. In most group situations, everyone does a bit of everything. I do think it&#8217;s useful to have a &#8216;chaser&#8217; but this is somebody who needs support from the tutor and probably the email addresses of the other students. Maybe the role thing would work better for a second or third group work.</p>\n<p><strong>Nit picking</strong><br />\nOur brief for week 3 began &#8220;Hello North Group&#8221; (we were West Group). Yes, I did wonder for a second if I was on the wrong page. Ah, the perils of cutting and pasting.</p>\n<p><strong>Navigation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Getting around any online environment is a lot easier if links are assembled logically and if link text describes the link page.</li>\n<li>How about putting the group lists before the group discussions, so we can see who we&#8217;re working with before we start working.</li>\n<li>Also, how about having the task on its own page so we can easily refer to it? It has been remarked that some re-reading of the task was done. Assume that this will be so and make it easy to find.</li>\n<li>Maybe have the reflections after the activity?</li>\n<li>The &#8216;week 3 activities&#8217; link goes to a page entitled, erm, week 3 learning outcomes. Is an outcome the same as an activity? Am I alone in finding this confusing? Actually, the word &#8216;activity&#8217; is only used on that page with reference to the activity that the students will be designing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(194,0,0,'Programming and branching scenarios','text/html','http://pauljinks.co.uk/?p=76&#038;utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=programming-and-branching-scenarios','Uncategorized',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,18,'The branching scenario tutorials produce multiple situations, and combinations of situations.

(Hobson)</a></p>\n<p>Open Learning (to me) Â focuses on the pedagogy of learning in an open environment which is facilitated by social media and digital tools. Â Open Content/Resources can be part of open learning. However, I believe that more meaningful learning is a result of the creation of new artifacts and development of new open content by the learners. Bringing a \"constructivist\" approach to \"connectivist\" ideas I suppose. Open learning is an \"extension\" of what is learned in the classroom and it encourages higher level thinking and skills based on Bloom&apos;s Taxonomy for example.<br />\n<strong><strong><br />\nHow can Open Learning in k12 create meaningful learning opportunities?</p>\n<p></strong></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" dir=\"ltr\">(Please consider this my first attempt at creating a framework so feedback is much appreciated.)</p>\n<p>Like any new subject, learners need to start with basic information, then connect and extend into more difficult applications of the content. This is how we have created our Education system. In math for example, we teach numeracy basics, patterns and geometry in kindergarten and rarely calculus at the beginning.</p>\n<p>I suggest that we need to see the integration of social media and social community literacy skills Â in the same way. Â The skills will be taught all the way up: however, the level of openness in an institutional setting, will be in stages.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><strong>Stages and Open Environments in Teaching Social Media Competencies</p>\n<p></strong></strong></p> <table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"75\" />\n<col width=\"165\" />\n<col width=\"384\" /></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>Age and Grade</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Type Of \"Open\" Environment</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stage 1</td>\n<td>Kindergarten to Age 13</td>\n<td>Walled Garden &#8211; Students open to other students and teachers<br />\nTeachers combine completely open options and walled garden options.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stage 2</td>\n<td>Age 14 to Age 17</td>\n<td>Transition between walled garden and completely open depending on activity and level of interaction with open world.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stage 3</td>\n<td>Age 18 +</td>\n<td>Open Learning</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table> <p>In my opinion,Â it would be logical to<strong> emphasize the competencies in k-age 13</strong> and extend, integrate, specialize and create authentic learning projects from age 14 and above.</p>\n<p>As in any educational situation, if a learner if able to demonstrate skills that meet and exceed their level, they can consider being placed in a different stage.</p>\n<p>If a Stage 2 or 3 learner collaborates with a stage 1 learner, the \"lower\" stage takes precedence.

The three main types of interactions are: student &#8211; student, student &#8211; content and student &#8211; teacher. In this framework, the emphasis is on student-student interactions and less emphasis on student &#8211; content and student -teacher interactions. Â These are huge changes from traditional teacher/content focused online courses.</p>\n<p>Some basic guidelines:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\nTo distinguish open learning from a regular \"great\" online course, is the addition of connections to the outside world and a focus on reflection of the basic competencies. Â With the addition of an \"open context\" students output is influenced (learners think about their audience, review their material in consideration of \"assumptions\" of others,consider their voice and tone as an author and learn to interact in meaningful ways with peers online including feedback.)</p>\n<p>We will learn form and with each other by creating networks, receiving feedback and reflecting on what we have created, to make something new.</p>\n<p>Ideas need to be scaffolded in order to facilitate new ways learning and new skills.</p>\n<p>The definition of \"peer\" will change. <a href=\"http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/full_pdfs/hanging_out.pdf\">According to Ito et al, (2010) </a>among youth, peers are most commonly distinguished based on materialistic values &#8211; \"what we see\". In online social environments, \"peers\" are seen for \"what they can do\".Collaboration and interaction is based on passion and skill, not what you look like.</p>\n<p>Open learning can be offered in face to face classroom environments and online classroom environments. It offers an opportunity to see, \"Learning as learning\".</p>\n<p><strong>Now that I have a framework I can begin looking for evidence to support this idea and start looking for common research in k12 and feedback!</strong></p>\n<p>Verena <img src=&apos;http://www.openclassroomonline.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif&apos; alt=&apos;:)&apos; class=&apos;wp-smiley&apos; /> </p>\n<p><strong id=\"internal-source-marker_0.027691790834069252\"><br />\n</strong></p>\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(206,0,0,'Great Discussion &#8220;DELL ThinkTank&#8221;','text/html','http://www.openclassroomonline.com/great-discussion-dell-thinktank/','Uncategorized',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,24,'I enjoyed listening to DELL&#8217;s ThinkTank through LiveStream Discussion on Innovation in Education k-12.

This explanation of separation also helped me distinguish the idea of technology as a \"tool\" as opposed to technology as an \"idea\" &#8211; it is both and it wasn&#8217;t my imagination.</p>\n<p>In our previous ETEC 511 module we discussed the evolution of trying to define Educational Technology and the fact that a distinct definition was evasive.</p>\n<p>Heidegger&apos;s ideaÂ of \"enframing\" seemed to mean encouraging (challenging) man to promote the new technology (idea or design ) in order for it to be truly revealed (accepted).</p>\n<p><strong>Upon reflection, I Â have been considering one of the largest barriers to the integration of technology in the classroom: <em>Â </em><em>fear</em>. Fear of the unknown, fear of doing something differently, fear of change. Although there are many advocates of Educational Technology attempting to \"enframe\" the technology to push society to new levels &#8211; I wonder if fear is an overriding factor that is preventing Â man from actually \"revealing\" the true potential of Educational Technology. I think it is.</strong></p>\n<p>As such, based on the philosophy of technology, if we as humans can \"hear and feel\" the challenge set forth, then we must, \"open ourselves expressly to the essence of technology\" (p. 26) to free ourselves and the possibility of new technology and innovation.<strong></strong></p>\n<p><em>How do I relate the fear of EdTech integration to the Open Classroom?</em></p>\n<p>When I sat for my interview I was given the questions ahead of time. Although I knew the questions, it was not necessarily what I wanted toÂ be asked- it was what I was being \"asked\" to say. There is nothing wrong with the interview &#8211; the journalists had a set time, set story, set plan &#8211; and they had deadlines to meet. The purpose of the interview was to create their story &#8211; not mine.</p>\n<p>As I was being interviewed, I had flashbacks to me teaching and &#8220;asking my students questions&#8221;.<br />\nI compared the interview to some of the Â f2f classroom teaching I have done where I have an agenda, it doesn&apos;t matter what the students really want to say &#8211; I need to complete my lesson.</p>\n<p>Why did I care that my &#8220;story&#8221; was not being told?Â Why didn&apos;t I ask questions and try to sway the interview? Well &#8211; it was for a TV show, and I am expected to represent a parent voice, not just Verena&apos;s voice. But I wasn&#8217;t learning anything new, there was no discussion, I couldn&apos;t ask for clarification &#8211; but again it was designed for a set audience. It wasn&#8217;t my story.<br />\nIt was the opposite of what I see the Open Classroom offering students. The Open Classroom should and will be a space to be \"interviewed\" and also a place to tell stories and learn from each other. It will be a space where students can feel safe and \"find\" their own voice as a result of the interactions with their peers.</p>\n<p>If anything, it will be a place where learning will reveal the truth about what people believe, who they are and what they are passionate about. It will be a place where learning is revealed to encourage and develop new learning and innovation.<strong></strong></p>\n<p>The Open Classroom offers the potential for technology and humans to grow.</p>\n<p>To conclude &#8211; and get back to my #vssmooc12 post as well&#8230;.Open Classrooms offer a new way of learning. It will not be classified as blended and definitely not traditional online learning &#8211; but it offers a future and potential of unlimited potential. I am proud to be an advocate of a new way of \"seeing and revealing\" Educational Technology today.</p>\n<p>Verena <img src=&apos;http://www.openclassroomonline.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif&apos; alt=&apos;:)&apos; class=&apos;wp-smiley&apos; /> </p>\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(208,0,0,'Ideas','text/html','http://www.openclassroomonline.com/ideas/','Uncategorized',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,24,'Why am I writing this blog and why do I want other people to contribute?

We were lucky enough to have Terry Anderson come in last week to discuss the future of online learning. Anderson (and others) collaborated to create the<a href=\"http://communitiesofinquiry.com/model\"> Community of Inquiry Model</a> for online learning. I will be using the CoI model to help create the &#8220;Open Classroom&#8221; in order to investigate the strengths and weaknesses from a pedagogical perspective. However, Anderson introduced our team to <a href=\"http://elgg.org/\">ELGG</a>, a social network software.

I need to compare the functions, limitations and strengths of D2L with the capabilities of an open platform. What is D2L could do everything that I wanted it to?

Both types bear some common features:<ul style=\"margin-top: 0cm;\" type=\"disc\"><li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1;\">Geographical spread of participants</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1;\">Big dropout rate although for AI courses is   much higher than for MOOCs (85% vs. approximately 40% respectively). </li><li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1;\">Massiveness, although AI courses have orders of   magnitude higher number of registered learners.</li></ul>But, they clearly differ in many fundamental aspects (especially in its pedagogical content) so as to establish two very different course formats:<ul style=\"margin-top: 0cm;\" type=\"disc\"><li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2;\">The AI fall into the cognitive-behaviorist   pedagogy category and the MOOCs&amp;nbsp;into the connectivist. </li><li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2;\">The AI participants have totally different   learner&apos;s goals and preparation than those in MOOCs.</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2;\">There exists a very different nature of the   subjects studied: in AI engineering&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;MOOCs educational   theory.</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2;\">MOOCs have a vast number of lurker participants   while AI have no lurkers.</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2;\">Tutors and facilitators bare very different   roles.</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;\">Openness   in each of the formats has also a different meaning. In AI it is more   related to the fact that the courses are open for anyone to take. In MOOCs it refers to: openness to the personalization of   learning, to the dialogue, debate, and conversation; to the novel,   divergent thinking, and creative thinking; to the participation based on   connection, collaboration, and sharing.</li></ul><br />Open Online courses represent an important development in open education but MOOCs (our MOOCs) in particular, a major change.<br />So, &amp;nbsp;it&apos;s time to call MOOCs something else.<br />OPENBLOCK1CLOSEBLOCK Cormier, D., and Siemens, G.

This analysis is similar to that recently posted in her blog by&amp;nbsp; Anne Zelenka (<a href=\"http://annezelenka.com/2012/02/16/getting-ready-for-connected-learning/\">http://annezelenka.com/2012/02/16/getting-ready-for-connected-learning/)</a> for the <a href=\"http://www.ml-class.org/course/auth/welcome\">Stanford machine learning class</a> by Andrew Ng and the LAK12 MOOC.<br /><br />Picture 1 shows the number of visitors to the main page of EduMOOC. Although it had nearly 2000 registered participants only 100/200 on average participated after the first weeks.(from Google analytics)<br />Picture 2 is the daily number of participants in the AI-Stanford class. It translates to around 25,000 number of daily visitors (between 1/3 and 1/4 of those that visit daily khanacademy.org). Observe that a similar pattern to the ai-class.com is starting to emerge for udacity.com. (from Alexa.com analytics).<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-csREPTwzreo/Tz6ZEr5hRsI/AAAAAAAAASQ/xqhO74Syd5s/s1600/13+august+2011.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"275\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-csREPTwzreo/Tz6ZEr5hRsI/AAAAAAAAASQ/xqhO74Syd5s/s640/13+august+2011.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Picture 1.

Comparison of number of daily visitors to ai-class.com, khanacademy.org and udacity.com</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It is clear that we are in the presence of very different course formats:<br /><ul><li>the AI-Stanford participants have totally different learners goals and preparation than those in MOOCs.</li><li>there exists a very different nature of the subjects studied: educational theory and engineering. </li><li>the retention behavior (number and pattern) in both type of the massive courses is totally different and worth researching further.&amp;nbsp;</li><li> the AI-Stanford course falls into the cognitive-behaviorist pedagogy category and the MOOCs&amp;nbsp; into the connectivist. </li></ul>I have actively participated, mostly with research interest, in 4 different MOOCs (2 from each format described above) and completed successfully the AI-Stanford course. I now joined the 7 weeks \"CS101 Building a Search Engine\" course that starts 20th of February. This time, sponsored by a spin-off of the AI-Stanford class : <a href=\"http://udacity.com/\">udacity.com</a>.<br /><br />In August 2011 during&amp;nbsp; EduMOOC, an active discussion emerged as to whether the AI-Stanford class was a MOOC (<a href=\"http://cor-ar.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2012-02-17T17:08:00-02:00&amp;amp;max-results=1&amp;amp;reverse-paginate=true\">see my previous posts</a>). I would definitely conclude that the AI-class was not a MOOC.<br /><br />These are very interesting times to apply learning analytics concepts&amp;nbsp; for researching these successful massive online courses.<br /><br />tag for: #lak12 and #change11<br /><br /><br /><br /><img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/829236275212075884-5420882071557525926?l=cor-ar.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(228,0,0,'REPLACING THE FAUCET','text/html','http://cor-ar.blogspot.com/2011/08/replacing-faucet.html',NULL,NULL,NULL,16,NULL,NULL,'2011-08-06 12:25:21',27,'In George Siemens blog post \"From knowledge to bathroom renovations\" (July 2nd 2011) (<a href=\"http://www.connectivism.ca/?p=325\">http://www.connectivism.ca/?p=325</a>), where he answers David Wileys comments on MOOCs, there are some clear statements where one can test if the Stanford AI course is a MOOC.<br /> 1.

Often it seems to be easier to produce the material by myself than to look for it in the web. In addition OER must be adapted for the context of my lessons. Furthermore Hatakka mentions that teachers need &#8220;trust&#8221; to use Internet material (p 11).</p>\n<p><strong>Quality:</strong> University teachers are shy to make their learning material available in the web because they are not sure about the quality. Maybe in German speaking countries there is more pressure to create best quality before you share than in English speaking countries. (The same is valid for blogs, etc).

Participants mention that the behaviour of others in the forum, the quality of personal connections (e.g. trolling), the unstructured discussion in the forum (with more than 1000 contributions in the first week) were inhibitors for learning.</p>\n<p>I wonder if these perceptions are caused by the use of a forum. In my experience of participating in the Change11 MOOC this behaviour. didn&#8217;t occur (or I didn&#8217;t observe them. Was there a Change11 troll??).

This topic is relevant for me as well as I&#8217;m giving the Keynote at the <a href=\"http://www.fh-joanneum.at/global/show_document.asp?id=aaaaaaaaaagvkvi\">11. eLearning Tag der FH JOANNEUM</a> next week (19.9.2012) about &#8220;What could be the impact of moderation in open online courses?.</p>\n<p>My talk will dicsuss the question how to support learners in open learning scenarious. Is there a possibility to combine moderation and learner autonomy? I loved to learn in the Change11 MOOC and ask myself how I can transfer this experience to my students and training participants? In February 2012 I did a first step offering an open training focussed on developing a network in Google+ and it worked more or less.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m curios and looking forward to discuss my considerations with the participants of both conferences.</p>\n<br /> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/zmldidaktik.wordpress.com/537/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/zmldidaktik.wordpress.com/537/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=zmldidaktik.wordpress.com&#038;blog=17426790&#038;post=537&#038;subd=zmldidaktik&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(243,0,0,'IdentitÃ¤t &#8211; wie viele sind wir?','text/html','http://zmldidaktik.wordpress.com/2012/09/09/identitat-wie-viele-sind-wir/','Reflexion;ZML-Leseclub',NULL,NULL,18,NULL,NULL,NULL,32,'Am 6.

IdentitÃ¤tsnuancen (Gudrun gefÃ¤llt &#8220;eine&#8221; einzige IdentitÃ¤t besser, wÃ¤hrend mich die Vorstellung vieler IdentitÃ¤ten durchaus anspricht). Wir sehen diese IdentitÃ¤ten/IdentitÃ¤tsnuancen jeweils als Kontinuum &#8211; so wie mein soziales Geschlecht konstruiert ist und sich im Lauf des Lebens verÃ¤ndert, ist auch meine IdentitÃ¤t/IdentitÃ¤tsnuance als Blogschreiberin Zyklen unterworfen und kÃ¶nnte als Kontinuum aufgefasst werden. Gudrun entdeckte dieses Kontinuum bei Wenger (Etienne Wenger \"Communities of Practice: Learning, Meaning, and Identity\"Â Cambridge University Press,1998), ich wurde damit in meiner Auseinandersetzung mit Gender konfrontiert &#8211; mein Geschlecht als Kontinuum zu begreifen, war eine Herausforderung.</p>\n<p>Bild 1 zeigt eine Skizze unserer AnnÃ¤herung an die IdentitÃ¤ten/IdentitÃ¤tsnuancen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zmldidaktik.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/identitaet1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-532\" title=\"identitaet1\" src=\"http://zmldidaktik.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/identitaet1.jpg?w=480\" alt=\"\"  /></a><br />\nDoch wie passt die Online-IdentitÃ¤t / die Online-IdentitÃ¤ten in dieses Bild?

Diese Grafik erzielte eine grÃ¶ÃŸere Zustimmung als der erste Versuch.</p>\n<p>In der weiteren Diskussion stellte Erika die These zur Diskussion, dass f2f IdentitÃ¤ten &#8220;flÃ¼chtiger&#8221; seien als Online-IdentitÃ¤ten. Obwohl die Menge an Inhalten im Web rasch anwÃ¤chst, bleiben unsere IdentitÃ¤tsspuren auffindbar und sind auch noch nach Jahren nachlesbar.

I appreciate Etienne&#8217;s sharing of his concepts and actual challenges and Bev&#8217;s efforts to support the group. In the last 2 days of the BEtreat I felt connected to nearly everybody and I got to know very interesting people!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>To give a short overview over my development and learning process</h3>\n<p><strong>Monday</strong></p>\n<p>Technology didn&#8217;t work and we needed a lot of time to deal technology, as sound was coming and going. Therefore there was not enough room for discussion and when there was a discussion I only understood glimpses because of breaking sound. At the first day I attended the BEtreat until after midnight, drinking a lot of coffee &#8211; and afterwards I was not able to sleep, and when I finally slept I had many dreams around the BEtreat!</p>\n<p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p>\n<p>I had nearly the whole Thursday to reflect about the BEtreat, continue to read in Etienne&#8217;s book &#8211; as in my time zone the BEtreat started at 17:00. I was so occupied with preparing and reflecting that I did only leave the house for 10 minutes to get some ice cream. Sometimes during the week Bev wondered why there were so many contributions of the onliners in the WIKI in comparison to the contributions of f2f people. In my case it was esay to explain: I had a lot of time to be online and contribute.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of Tuesday the problems with technology continued &#8211; nevertheless Etienne and Bev did a good job of swapping computers, using different microphones, &#8230; andÂ Â finally for the last session we decided to only use audio and it worked &#8211; it was possible to listen to the discussion for 1,5 hours without problems. So I started to immerse into the Â BEtreat experience.</p>\n<p>With respect to content: it was planned that we reviewed / discussed nearly the whole book about Communities of Practice of Etienne Wenger in the first 2 days. And we finished doing this in the first session of Wednesday.</p>\n<p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p>\n<p>In the morning I reflected that I felt lost within the entire BEtreat group. It was not possible to see who is speaking, when the discussion was &#8220;hot&#8221;, f2f people forgot the microphones and nobody ever said his or her name before speaking. I wrote about it and developed a plan to change it &#8211; for further details take a look at my blog post: <a title=\"Permanentlink zu In the middle ofÂ BEtreat\" href=\"http://zmldidaktik.wordpress.com/2012/08/01/in-the-middle-of-betreat/\" rel=\"bookmark\">In the middle ofÂ BEtreat</a></p>\n<p>So during the day I was very occupied Â putting my plan into action and writing a lot of e-mails. Overall during this week I wrote and got 104 e-mails although the BEtreat was a synchronous event!</p>\n<p>When we started on Wednesday 17:00 technology finally worked really well: it was possible to observe what was happening in Wengers&#8217; garden via 2 webcams Â in adobe and we had nice sound via skype worked well &#8211; the f2f people were sitting around a round table, they used the microphones in a better way and said their name as well. Furthermore we had a kind of informal discussion at the beginning, there was laughing and speaking of f2f people and onliners.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday we discussed &#8220;Power and Identification&#8221; (chapters of Etienne&#8217;s book) and then Etienne and Bev shared their actual work with us and we discussed about learning landscapes and how the cooperation of different communities of practice could work. Bev brought an example from her work which gave us interesting insights.</p>\n<p>Additionally on Wednesday started the work of the thematic groups as well, we were invited to work on our personal booths and bring them together in our thematic group. The last session was the presentation of two booths of f2f participants, as it was difficult to follow and it was very late, I stopped after the first booth.</p>\n<p><strong>Thursday</strong></p>\n<p>As everyday until Thursday in the morning I immersed myself into the BEtreat &#8211; this time by writing the blog post <a title=\"Permanentlink zu Did I reach my objectives in theÂ BEtreat?\" href=\"http://zmldidaktik.wordpress.com/2012/08/02/did-i-reach-my-objectives-in-the-betreat/\" rel=\"bookmark\">Did I reach my objectives in theÂ BEtreat?</a>Â - but then for the first time during this week I left my house for entire 3 hours and spent nice time in the city, &#8230; telling my husband about the BEtreat.</p>\n<p>When I returned to my laptop I finished my booth. At this day, the 4th day in the BEtreat my thematic group started 45 min earlier to plan our 3 hours. We did a good job and finished with a nice timeline, we planned to do our booths individually and then to create discussions in 3 separated groups about &#8220;What is an effective learning environment?&#8221;.</p>\n<p>As technology worked well and I felt connected with the group I started to actually &#8220;say&#8221; something in the discussions as well &#8211; whereas until then I confined myself on writing in the chat. It is not easy to speak in a foreign language when it is not possible to see reactions in the faces of the listeners (and the video was of the whole group, not of single faces) &#8211; and when technology is not 100% available.</p>\n<p>During the synchronous session I enjoyed the thematic group about the &#8220;Value creation framework&#8221;. I got a good insight in theory and practice and am wondering how I will use it in my future work.</p>\n<p>Then it was time for the booths of our thematic group &#8211; and I was a little bit nervous how my booth will work which started near midnight. In my perception it went ok and afterwards I waited for Jenny&#8217;s booth and was fascinated by her approach of &#8220;emerging learning&#8221; and how to &#8220;measure&#8221; it with so-called &#8220;footprints&#8221;. Â I&#8217;m looking forward to apply her scheme to my courses.</p>\n<p><strong>Friday</strong></p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t go into the BEtreat during the morning and when I started I was relaxed and felt connected &#8211; until reading a comment in the critical friends page about &#8220;This morning very superficial &#8230; online offline thing is a total waste of time&#8230; &#8220;. I was shocked and hurt.</p>\n<p>But when the BEtreat started &#8211; I felt connected with the group, it was nice and easy to listen to the reports of face-to-face participants from dancing during night in the Â village and I could accept the critical comment more easily.</p>\n<p>Our thematic group finished the session successfully and then it was time to reflect. Etienne and Bev asked us in which group we wanted to do the reflection: in the reading group, the thematicÂ group or the leadership group &#8211; and I was astonished to discover that I was most connected with the thematic group <img src=&apos;http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif&apos; alt=&apos;:-)&apos; class=&apos;wp-smiley&apos; /> </p>\n<p>With respect to the Friday session I want to citate Jenny with her definition of openness which I like very much:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Openness is a way of being, it&#8217;s a stage of mind &#8211; willing to share a lot, expose oneself &#8211; openness is an inherent believe, confidence might develop as one grows by working in that way</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>The conveners of the BEtreat</strong></p>\n<p>It was interesting for me to listen to Etienne why he appreciates f2f work more than online work. I remember that he said: &#8220;I like to work with a tight schedule&#8221; (as we could experience in this BEtreat) &#8221; and online discussions never end&#8221;.</p>\n<p>In discourse with Bev I got the feeling that we see learning processes in a different way. I shared my experiences of asummer circus school with the group &#8211; where children are building a community of practice in juggling. I focussed on the freedom for learning and making mistakes and their being creative and inventing new juggling tricks all the time and nobody tells them how to do it. In my perception these components enable them to learn deeply and in a democratic way. After my story Bev told us Â that she worked once in a circus school and that the children prepared for the big show at the end of school &#8211; and that this challenge was mainly responsible for their creativity. Also in my example there are 2 half days of show where every child out Â of about 350 children has two appearances &#8211; but I forgot to tell everybody about the show as it wasn&#8217;t that important for my understanding of learning!</p> <a href=&apos;http://zmldidaktik.wordpress.com/2012/08/04/my-personal-review-of-betreat/f2f-group/&apos; title=&apos;f2f-group&apos;><img data-liked=&apos;0&apos; data-reblogged=&apos;0&apos;data-attachment-id=\"519\" data-orig-file=\"http://zmldidaktik.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/f2f-group.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"400,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:3,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon IXUS 230 HS&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:1343652787,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:5,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:0.016666666666667,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://zmldidaktik.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/f2f-group.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://zmldidaktik.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/f2f-group.jpg?w=400\" width=\"150\" height=\"112\" src=\"http://zmldidaktik.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/f2f-group.jpg?w=150&h=112\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"f2f-group\" title=\"f2f-group\" /></a>\n<a href=&apos;http://zmldidaktik.wordpress.com/2012/08/04/my-personal-review-of-betreat/onliners/&apos; title=&apos;onliners&apos;><img data-liked=&apos;0&apos; data-reblogged=&apos;0&apos;data-attachment-id=\"520\" data-orig-file=\"http://zmldidaktik.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/onliners.png\" data-orig-size=\"400,250\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:0,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:0,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:0,&quot;iso&quot;:0,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:0,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://zmldidaktik.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/onliners.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://zmldidaktik.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/onliners.png?w=400\" width=\"150\" height=\"93\" src=\"http://zmldidaktik.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/onliners.png?w=150&h=93\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"onliners\" title=\"onliners\" /></a> <p><em>Probably my longest blog post ever!</em></p>\n<br /> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/zmldidaktik.wordpress.com/517/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/zmldidaktik.wordpress.com/517/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=zmldidaktik.wordpress.com&#038;blog=17426790&#038;post=517&#038;subd=zmldidaktik&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(246,0,0,'My booth in the BEtreat 2012','text/html','http://zmldidaktik.wordpress.com/2012/08/03/my-booth-in-the-betreat-2012/','BEtreat;Reflexion;Veranstaltung / Training',NULL,NULL,18,NULL,NULL,NULL,32,'To document the learning processes the Wengers are using a huge WIKI and all groups have their virtual room in the WIKI.

Depending of technology I made it to follow the discussions or I failed. As English is not my mother tongue I&#8217;m lost if sound is swallowing half words. So my understanding sometimes worked and sometimes didn&#8217;t work. As my interest lies in the application of theories and not in theories itself I was sometimes lost when different theories, names, ideas where dropped without further detailed explication.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless that the learning room wasn&#8217;t ideal I believe that I learned a lot. My head is full of sentences, half ideas, my nights are full of dreams about the BEtreat &#8211; how much I will finally get out of it will depend of my time I can invest into debriefing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>to experience how the integration of f2f and online learners could work mainly using synchronous learning</h3>\n<p>The training design is very challenging for online participants (I don&#8217;t know how it is for f2f participants). When I wake up in the morning I open my computer, check what was going on during (my) night, plan my BEtreat day, write in my personal booth, reflect in my blog. Additionally there is to do some &#8220;normal&#8221; work, at least check e-mails.</p>\n<p>So when the BEtreat starts at about 16:30 I already did a lot of work. During the evening I&#8217;m participating, writing notes, trying to understand, sometimes make a comment, ask a question. And as I&#8217;m getting more tired when midnight approaches my competences of English and of understanding complex discussions diminish!</p>\n<p>Yesterday technology worked well &#8211; there were the online participants with frozen pictures in adobe, a video of the group in California and skype for audio. It was possible for me to understand a little bit how the f2f participants are doing.</p>\n<p>So, yes, I did experience a synchronous training with f2f and online participants &#8211; and got an understanding about it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>to get new ideas for my online training design &#8211; being at the edge to open up closed training scenarios</h3>\n<p>Starting with theory the most important aspects for me are Etienne&#8217;s &#8220;axes&#8221; &#8211; every aspect has to be negotiated, f.e. structure &#8211; action, identity &#8211; praxis, or the axes: vertical and horizontal power (maybe transverse power as well). And I want to integrate some of it in my trainings (I&#8217;m curios how I will do it).</p>\n<p>With regard to the training design I&#8217;m happy to participate in this training but I would never adopt such a design. I feel that the training design imposes f2 schedules on online learners and does not give room for the potential of online learning, e.g for asynchronous processes or to support smaller groups of f2f and online learners.</p>\n<p>When there is group work during the training f2f and online participants are separated. In my perception the f2f participants prefer discussions without online persons (probably is is much easier for them and there is the flow of discussing without anybody dropping in and out because of technology). (My perception is influenced by Jenny&#8217;s post where she described her experience as f2f participant in a BEtreat and how happy the f2f group was without online participants).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>to build a group of learners (f2f and online) and to do work together</h3>\n<p>In my perception the building process for the whole group is at a very early stage. I have a good cooperation with the &#8220;onliners&#8221; &#8211; and yesterday the informal part at the start of the BEtreat session helped a little bit to get to know the f2f persons. But then I looked at the photos and couldn&#8217;t produce names to them.</p>\n<p>There is not much contact between the f2f group and the online group. Etienne and Bev are eager to handle technology to bring us onliners in &#8211; but in this way the Â f2f participants don&#8217;t have responsibility for us. So the buddy system of one online and one f2f participant doesn&#8217;t work and it is not necessary that it works.</p>\n<p>At the beginning my leadership group of &#8220;social reporters&#8221; had some contact between f2f and online persons (which was very nice!) &#8211; but in the next days the group separated into f2f and online persons. The group wiki is filled with much more information of the onliners.</p>\n<p>Furthermore I was in a mixed reading group and am now in a mixed thematic group. But as group building needs time Â - which we do not have because of an overfull calendar &#8211; no groups are building. In the thematic group we have 3 hours for presentations, discussions, activities &#8211; but as we couldn&#8217;t find a common topic yesterday evening Â we will do single presentations (and we have reserved some time for a joint enterprise, which we will discuss today).</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m very happy about the online group and a little bit disappointed about the performance of the BEtreaters group as a whole.</p>\n<br /> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/zmldidaktik.wordpress.com/505/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/zmldidaktik.wordpress.com/505/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=zmldidaktik.wordpress.com&#038;blog=17426790&#038;post=505&#038;subd=zmldidaktik&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(248,0,0,'In the middle of BEtreat','text/html','http://zmldidaktik.wordpress.com/2012/08/01/in-the-middle-of-betreat/','BEtreat;Reflexion;Veranstaltung / Training;#betreat12',NULL,NULL,18,NULL,NULL,NULL,32,'Today is already Wednesday in the BEtreat &#8211; and this night I slept well and long, having been online until after midnight.

We did a lot of theoretical discussions about Wenger&#8217;s chapters about: communities and learning, boundaries and scale and identity. Fortunately the participants contributed with practical examples as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Plan for today:</strong> read the chat protocols (Bev did a great job writing notes) and reflect (I&#8217;m curios if this will work).</p>\nBased on yesterday&#8217;s discussion and because it was the topic of my preparatory reading as well I&#8217;m thinking about <strong>identity and belonging</strong>Â in context with the BEtreat training: <ul>\n<li>I&#8217;m belonging to the BEtreat online group of course &#8211; we are 8 persons, but as Junko comes from Japan she cannot attend all sessions (for Junko we are starting at 0:00!)</li>\n<li>And there is a sub-group of Jenny and myself as Change MOOCers &#8211; we have been in online contact during the last 10 months.</li>\n<li>Then I&#8217;m in another sub-group with Cristina as she is Italian and living near <img src=&apos;http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif&apos; alt=&apos;:-)&apos; class=&apos;wp-smiley&apos; /> .</li>\n<li>I&#8217;m part of Â another sub-group as well, of our leadership group. We are social reporters and according to the Wengers&#8217; plan we are &#8220;r<em>esponsible for creating a shared, internal memory&#8221; </em>- but our WIKI is nearly empty, I&#8217;m strongly missing pictures of the f2f group working.</li>\n<li>Probably I should be in a sub-group with my buddy as well (every online person has a f2f buddy) but as she didn&#8217;t enter skype once yesterday I&#8217;m without buddy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Plan for today:</strong> urgently get in contact with the f2f group and my buddy!</p>\n<p>I believe we in the BEtreat group have a serious time problem. The agenda is ultra full and as there are so many discussions the breaks are shortened and during breaks there are tech checks if necessary. After following an online discussion of 2 hours I&#8217;m happy to have a break myself as well. So I do not get in contact with others f2f &#8211; and as there is a bandwidth problem as well the f2f participants normally are not online as well.</p>\n<p>If the objective of the training is to discuss theory and to listen to Etienne as much as possible yesterday /Tuesday with a full agenda and working audio was perfect.</p>\n<p>As I&#8217;m a more pragmatic and applied person yesterday was ok but I&#8217;m looking forward to some development of the training &#8211; so I hope that today the theory review and preview will not need too much time.</p>\n<p><strong>Plan for today:</strong> Get in contact with the agenda activists and negotiate the agenda.</p>\n<p>My interest is to build on Wenger&#8217;s theory of CoPs and to use his concepts to create our own CoP &#8220;here&#8221; in the BEtreat. This is a challenge as our CoP includes f2f AND online people.</p>\n<p>In my experience an online group and a &#8220;mixed&#8221; group as well needs trust to learn well together. I want to get used to everybody, to have an inner picture of everybody. I have this inner picture of all online participants, I know the names and at least the skype photo (and I remember the Adobe video of Monday). But I don&#8217;t have this picture of any of the f2f participants &#8230; I only know some of the names.</p>\n<p>To get this trust and confidence I tried the question about our favorite country which worked rather well (I will have to check who&#8217;s info is missing until now). But I would need more. I would want to get in one-to-one video conferences via skype &#8211; but not during the break but as part of the agenda! I want to speak personally to Angie, Diane, Jimmy, &#8230;.</p>\n<p><strong>Plan for today:</strong> Propose this idea (I&#8217;m wondering where?? Maybe I will get into contact with the community keepers).</p>\n<p>Furthermore the f2f participants should understand what online participation means.</p>\n<p><strong>Plan for today:</strong>Â Put all the screenshots of yesterday into the social reporter wiki.</p>\n<p>So &#8211; you other online BEtreaters, what do you think about these plans?</p>\n<p>And you &#8211; unknown f2f BEtreaters would you like and are you ready to get in closer contact with us??</p> <br /> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/zmldidaktik.wordpress.com/490/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/zmldidaktik.wordpress.com/490/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=zmldidaktik.wordpress.com&#038;blog=17426790&#038;post=490&#038;subd=zmldidaktik&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(249,0,0,'Talk talk (Monday in the BEtreat)','text/html','http://zmldidaktik.wordpress.com/2012/07/31/talk-talk-monday-in-the-betreat/','BEtreat;Reflexion;Veranstaltung / Training;#betreat12',NULL,NULL,18,NULL,NULL,NULL,32,'What a coincidence that I&#8217;m reading Talk talk of T.C.

AsÃ­ que los que no se dejaron ver la piel por allÃ­ pudieron asistir casi en directo porque hubo mucha actividad tanto en las redes sociales como en el streaming de vÃ­deo.</p>\n<p><a href=&quot;http://tecnodoc.uc3m.es/node/18&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>leer mÃ¡s</a></p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(279,0,0,'e-SciDR Workshop, &quot;Towards an European Infraestructure of e-Science Digital Repositories&quot;, Lisboa 4/09/2007','text/html','http://tecnodoc.uc3m.es/node/16',NULL,NULL,NULL,19,NULL,NULL,NULL,34,'<p>El pasado lunes 3 de septiembre comenc&amp;eacute; mi estancia en el <strong><a href=&quot;http://www.dsi.uminho.pt&quot;>Departamento de Sistemas de Informaci&amp;oacute;n</a></strong> de la <strong><a href=&quot;http://www.uminho.pt&quot;>Universidad de Minho</a></strong><a href=&quot;http://www.uminho.pt&quot;> </a> (Guimaraes, Portugal) y nada m&amp;aacute;s llegar surgi&amp;oacute; la oportunidad de acudir al Workshop final del <strong><a href=&quot;http://www.e-scidr.eu&quot;>e-SciDR</a></strong>, que se celebraba al d&amp;iacute;a siguiente en Lisboa, en los Archivos Nacionales, Torre del Pombo.</p>\n<p><a href=&quot;http://tecnodoc.uc3m.es/node/16&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>leer mÃ¡s</a></p>',1347893524,NULL,NULL,'gbueno','http://tecnodoc.uc3m.es','Mon, 10 Sep 2007 09:59:28 +0000',NULL,'Tecnodoc - Grupo de investigaciÃ³n',NULL,'<p>El pasado lunes 3 de septiembre comenc&amp;eacute; mi estancia en el <strong><a href=&quot;http://www.dsi.uminho.pt&quot;>Departamento de Sistemas de Informaci&amp;oacute;n</a></strong> de la <strong><a href=&quot;http://www.uminho.pt&quot;>Universidad de Minho</a></strong><a href=&quot;http://www.uminho.pt&quot;> </a> (Guimaraes, Portugal) y nada m&amp;aacute;s llegar surgi&amp;oacute; la oportunidad de acudir al Workshop final del <strong><a href=&quot;http://www.e-scidr.eu&quot;>e-SciDR</a></strong>, que se celebraba al d&amp;iacute;a siguiente en Lisboa, en los Archivos Nacionales, Torre del Pombo.</p>\n<p><a href=&quot;http://tecnodoc.uc3m.es/node/16&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>leer mÃ¡s</a></p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(280,16,0,'#oped12 Contenuti aperti','text/html','http://serenaturri.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/oped12/','Mappe;OCL4Ed;Cmap;cmap tools;domande;flashback;OER;open course',NULL,NULL,20,NULL,NULL,NULL,36,'&#160; Flashback primoÂ Â  Flashback secondoÂ  ( sui dati aperti in Italia&#8230;). &#160; &#160; Una curiositÃ  Â«La modalitÃ  a cattedrale Ã¨ usata dagli editori di enciclopedie commerciali [...] la modalitÃ  a bazar Ã¨ quella utilizzata da WikipediaÂ» &#160; &#160; Una mappa: fattori che ostacolano il riutilizzo dei contenuti aperti &#160; La mappa elaborata con Cmap Tools [...]<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=serenaturri.wordpress.com&#038;blog=9618855&#038;post=2139&#038;subd=serenaturri&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',1347893762,NULL,NULL,'serenaturri','http://serenaturri.wordpress.com','Wed, 12 Sep 2012 19:35:52 +0000',NULL,'serenaturri&#039;s Blog','16','<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://serenaturri.wordpress.com/2012/06/27/ocl4ed-osservazioni-sulla-seconda-sessione-del-laboratorio/\"><strong>Flashback primoÂ Â </strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://serenaturri.wordpress.com/2012/07/04/ocl4ed-riflessioni-sulla-quarta-sessione-del-laboratorio/\"><strong>Flashback secondo</strong></a>Â  ( sui dati aperti in Italia&#8230;).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Una curiositÃ </strong> Â«<a href=\"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Cattedrale_e_il_Bazaar\">La modalitÃ  a cattedrale Ã¨ usata dagli editori di enciclopedie commerciali [...] la modalitÃ  a bazar Ã¨ quella utilizzata da Wikipedia</a>Â»</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Una mappa</strong>: fattori che ostacolano il riutilizzo dei contenuti aperti</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://serenaturri.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/fattori-inibenti-cosa-ostacola-il-riutilizzo-dei-contenuti-aperti.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2141\" title=\"Fattori inibenti - cosa ostacola il riutilizzo dei contenuti aperti\" src=\"http://serenaturri.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/fattori-inibenti-cosa-ostacola-il-riutilizzo-dei-contenuti-aperti.jpg?w=500&h=345\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"345\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">La mappa elaborata con Cmap Tools Ã¨ la trasposizione della tavola 3 reperita in</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.ejisdc.org/ojs2/index.php/ejisdc/article/viewFile/545/279\">BUILD IT AND THEY WILL COME?

In esso Lisa parla delle circostanze che l&#8217;hanno condotta a consultare la voce MOOC su Wikipedia, versione inglese e il turbamento che ha riportato in seguito alla lettura della nota (del luglio2012) che precede l&#8217;articolo stesso. Riferisce al contempo la <a href=\"http://lisahistory.net/wordpress/2011/07/diderot-come-help-your-encylopedia/\">genesi </a>dell&#8217;articolo di cui Ã¨ stata la compilatrice.</p>\n<p>Come il post di Lisa Ã¨ stato commentato con espressioni di pubblica solidarietÃ , anche la segnalazione di Altamirano ha trovato un seguito di commenti fra i quali il mio in cui ho segnalato di aver espressoÂ nel <a href=\"https://serenaturri.wordpress.com/2012/07/23/su-xcmoocs-e-wikipedia/\">mio post</a> del 7 luglio u.s.le perplessitÃ  sulle osservazione formulate nei confronti dell&#8217;articolo su Wikipedia.</p>\n<p>Sono stata attratta dalla risposta di Lisa al commento di John dalla quale ho compreso cheÂ <a id=\"js_3\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/davidandrewcormier\">Dave Cormier </a>ha modificato l&#8217;articolo su Wikipedia.Â  La variazione ha comportato la cancellazione della nota introduttiva, conseguentemente qualsiasi link, compreso il mio,Â  ha perso la sua ragione d&#8217;essere. Fortunatamente lo screenshot della nota critica che Lisa M Lane ha inserito nel suo articolo per documentare la causa del suo turbamento, fornisce un riscontro della validitÃ  delÂ  link da me segnalato. SarÃ  mia cura provvedere all&#8217;aggiornamento di quel post quanto prima.</p>\n<p>Quali insegnamenti si possono ricavare dal fatto narrato? Molti, probabilmente tanti quanti sono gli attori coinvolti.</p>\n<p>Quali questioni ha sollevato? Una fra le molte: come fare a recuperare una pagina non piÃ¹ esistente perchÃ© cancellata? Quali sono le possibili soluzioni? Forse che il ricorso al <a href=\"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink\">permalink </a>puÃ² costituire una soluzione? Non mi risulta.</p>\n<p>Ãˆ possibile che certe modifiche riscontrate in alcuni post e riconoscibili dalle parole/frasi barrate (es.parole barrate) rappresentino una risposta?Â  E il ricorso all&#8217;espressione Â«articolo modificatoÂ» per quantoÂ corretto Ã¨ da ritenersi risolutivo?</p>\n<p>Sono del parere che il problema sollevato riguardi le competenze digitali e nello specifico sia riconducibileÂ  alla dimensione etica che si riferisce alle Â«conoscenze relative ai comportamenti, piÃ¹ o meno opportuni, richiesti dal mondo delle tecnologie e della reteÂ». </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<br />Filed under: <a href=&apos;http://serenaturri.wordpress.com/category/lifelong-learning/&apos;>Lifelong Learning</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/serenaturri.wordpress.com/2094/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/serenaturri.wordpress.com/2094/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=serenaturri.wordpress.com&#038;blog=9618855&#038;post=2094&#038;subd=serenaturri&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(285,0,0,'#mobiMOOC12: gruppo Google','text/html','http://serenaturri.wordpress.com/2012/08/22/mobimooc12-gruppo-google/','mobiMOOC;apprendimento;cMOOc;Google group;lingua_inglese;tecnologia',NULL,NULL,20,NULL,NULL,NULL,36,'Prendo in esame il luogo d&apos;incontro per tutti i partecipanti del corso MobiMOOC2012: lo spazio del gruppo Google.

Ho bisogno di indagare, esplorare, analizzare per individuare le questioni sottese al sistema dei badges. Mi chiedo quale siano le domande a cui il badge fornisce risposte. Hanno forse a che fare con l&#8217;apprendimento centrato sugli interessi dello studente che persegue un apprendimento coinvolgente che si svolge non in una scuola, ma in un ambiente adeguato utilizzando una tecnologia che lo<br />\nconnette al resto del mondo, non importa dove sia?

Sono proprio questi ultimi a fornire la chiave per <a href=\"http://planet.openbadges.org/\">guardareÂ  un sistema di badge</a> da una molteplicitÃ  di angoli di visuale. Dalla lettura dell&#8217;articolo <a href=\"http://nbtimes.it/tecnologie/internet/11851/google-in-un-badge-cio-che-interessa-leggere.html\">Google, in un badge ciÃ² che interessa leggereÂ  </a>si apprende che Â«Google News, nella sua versione in inglese, si Ã¨ dotato di un nuovo meccanismo di classificazione, evidenziazione e condivisione dei propri interessi di lettura: il \"badge\"[...]Â Continuando a leggere sugli stessi temi, ogni badge potrÃ  \"crescere di livello\": si parte dal bronzo, poi c&apos;Ã¨ l&apos;argento, l&apos;oro e il piÃ¹ \"prestigioso\"Â». Si tratta dunque di una scala di valutazione espressa in badge.\nSe questa puÃ² essere considerataÂ  una caratteristica utile non Ã¨ da scordare che facendo registrare a Google la propria attivitÃ Â  gli si consegnano dei dati. Ãˆ lecito a questo punto valutare se i benefici sono tali da giustificare eventuali rischi.

If it is cut, it will leave only one fully fledged art history department left in Victoria, limiting the choice for students and affecting the future of Australian galleries and museums.<br />The <a href=\"http://melbourneartnetwork.com.au/2012/07/18/aaanz-letter-save-art-history-at-la-trobe/\">Art Association of Australia and New Zealand</a> (AAANZ) and the <a href=\"http://www.visualarts.net.au/newsdesk/2012/07/petition-to-save-art-history-at-la-trobe\">National Association for the Visual Arts</a> (NAVA) have both written in protest about the national implications of this destruction. And many of those who support the department have signed an <a href=\"http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/art_history_la_trobe/signatures\">online petition</a> protesting the cuts.<br />But when the department is thriving with good student retention rates and staff with high research output â€“ the question is, why close it down at all?<br /><h2> A visual world</h2><blockquote>\"Society changes. The world is a more crowded and in parts a more dangerous place. Post-Cold War realities, new technology and globalisation have altered the way we do almost everything.\"</blockquote>So said <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/no-barbarians-just-faculty-finetuning-20120716-2262q.html\">Tim Murray</a>, La Trobe&apos;s dean of humanities and social sciences, in last week&apos;s Age justifying the cuts made to the humanities school. It is a pity that Murray, as quoted above, so clearly demonstrates his own failure to grasp either the nature of the changes that our society is undergoing â€“ or that a part of the solution lies in one of the very academic disciplines he is attempting to eliminate.<br />Over the last century, the greatest single change that has taken place in how humanity receives and gives information has been the surging power of the visual image.

If it is cut, it will leave only one fully fledged art history department left in Victoria, limiting the choice for students and affecting the future of Australian galleries and museums.<br />The <a href=\"http://melbourneartnetwork.com.au/2012/07/18/aaanz-letter-save-art-history-at-la-trobe/\">Art Association of Australia and New Zealand</a> (AAANZ) and the <a href=\"http://www.visualarts.net.au/newsdesk/2012/07/petition-to-save-art-history-at-la-trobe\">National Association for the Visual Arts</a> (NAVA) have both written in protest about the national implications of this destruction. And many of those who support the department have signed an <a href=\"http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/art_history_la_trobe/signatures\">online petition</a> protesting the cuts.<br />But when the department is thriving with good student retention rates and staff with high research output â€“ the question is, why close it down at all?<br /><h2> A visual world</h2><blockquote>\"Society changes. The world is a more crowded and in parts a more dangerous place. Post-Cold War realities, new technology and globalisation have altered the way we do almost everything.\"</blockquote>So said <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/no-barbarians-just-faculty-finetuning-20120716-2262q.html\">Tim Murray</a>, La Trobe&apos;s dean of humanities and social sciences, in last week&apos;s Age justifying the cuts made to the humanities school. It is a pity that Murray, as quoted above, so clearly demonstrates his own failure to grasp either the nature of the changes that our society is undergoing â€“ or that a part of the solution lies in one of the very academic disciplines he is attempting to eliminate.<br />Over the last century, the greatest single change that has taken place in how humanity receives and gives information has been the surging power of the visual image. The revival of scholarship that came with the Renaissance was the power of the printed word and consequent mass literacy. With the 20th century so came cinema, and later the rise of digital technologies.<br />Visual information now crosses boundaries of language and culture. Younger generations are able to gleefully critique visual artefacts. Indeed, the average adolescent is now as aware of the many layers of meaning contained within a YouTube video as any medieval parishioner following the Christian narrative via stained glass window and statuary.<br />Art history teaches the vital visual skills needed for students to understand a society that now communicates so much through image.<br /><h2> An Australian contribution</h2>Studying visual images also gives a sense of structure to the past.

But to argue that governments are thus unfair monopolies cannot be sustained. Many \"private\" companies feed at the government &apos;s monopoly trough. <br> On the other hand, publishers only exist BECAUSE OF government intervention in the marketplace. The government gives them a privileged monopoly or copy right. The government is thus constraining trade and interfering in the free market for their benefit. This is allowed for a noble reason to support the creators of knowledge and art. But for publishers to claim that they have a free market is just not true. They should sit on their privileged monopoly and be happy that the government suffers them to describe (in an Orwellian fashion) their monopoly as \"intellectual property\".<br> <br> All the best.<br> Rory</p>\n<p>On 12-08-02 8:19 AM, Cable Green wrote:</p>\n<p>Hi All:<br> <br> Jacky and I are friends, but she knows I disagree with her on this point ;)<br> <br> My take is: (someone please correct me if any of my information is wrong)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Given the current market (and education policy) is not working for elementary students in Poland.&nbsp; Parents have to buy textbooks for their children.

But to argue that governments are thus unfair monopolies cannot be sustained. Many \"private\" companies feed at the government &apos;s monopoly trough. <br> On the other hand, publishers only exist BECAUSE OF government intervention in the marketplace. The government gives them a privileged monopoly or copy right. The government is thus constraining trade and interfering in the free market for their benefit. This is allowed for a noble reason to support the creators of knowledge and art. But for publishers to claim that they have a free market is just not true. They should sit on their privileged monopoly and be happy that the government suffers them to describe (in an Orwellian fashion) their monopoly as \"intellectual property\".<br> <br> All the best.<br> Rory</p>\n<p>On 12-08-02 8:19 AM, Cable Green wrote:</p>\n<p>Hi All:<br> <br> Jacky and I are friends, but she knows I disagree with her on this point ;)<br> <br> My take is: (someone please correct me if any of my information is wrong)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Given the current market (and education policy) is not working for elementary students in Poland.&nbsp; Parents have to buy textbooks for their children.

Partially its ironic because as a society we suffer from inversion. Even more than <a href=\"http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/PlatosCave.htm\" title=\"Plato&apos;s Cave Allegory\" target=\"_blank\">Plato&apos;s cave allegory</a>, reality seems inverted in many ways. Flipping is a way of revealing this. I was thinking about this in terms of cheating on tests and how to detect it following up on an earlier entry on <a href=\"http://blogasaurus.posterous.com/stealth-assessment-authentic-tests\" title=\"Stealth Assessment\" target=\"_blank\">Stealth Assessment and Authentic Testing</a>. In an unambiguous discipline where there is one right answer, perhaps it is easy to show you know the answer by cheating. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://getfile9.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2012-06-11/CtjyjdvGfgHIHkwAersfrjnbBHiCnltEDeFnfjtuJCHdIpEpjFAJBmabDzdE/Sound_Crew_2.JPG.scaled1000.jpg\"><img alt=\"Sound_crew_2\" height=\"376\" src=\"http://getfile6.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2012-06-11/CtjyjdvGfgHIHkwAersfrjnbBHiCnltEDeFnfjtuJCHdIpEpjFAJBmabDzdE/Sound_Crew_2.JPG.scaled500.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a> </p>\n<p>In terms of motivating a student to learn, it is giving responsibility and creating an environment that has real world implications to their actions. &nbsp;Their actions are a demonstration of their competency. &nbsp;It is impossible to cheat. Knowledge is agile, not simply a competency. It results in action. &nbsp;If you can authenticate that action there is no ambiguity.</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://getfile4.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2012-06-11/yhDrwiwllotkkfyAHCqCHdbxkIylCGDfBmpBJcgIFJDABvFBJEgvCIzxanct/BrettAdamBen2008.JPG.scaled1000.jpg\"><img alt=\"Brettadamben2008\" height=\"375\" src=\"http://getfile6.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2012-06-11/yhDrwiwllotkkfyAHCqCHdbxkIylCGDfBmpBJcgIFJDABvFBJEgvCIzxanct/BrettAdamBen2008.JPG.scaled500.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a> </p>\n<p>As well as reversing the expectation of a test on a given date and time, a flipped assessment is stretched out, on going. The idea of assessment is more like a story revealing itself over time. The student is the author. A test can be too narrow, a missed opportunity to have us take ownership of our stories. The &apos;test&apos; is not given by a teacher, but rather the role is to facilitate the student to self assess and create their stories.

Why couldn&apos;t we apply the lessons learned from <a href=\"http://blog.sparked.com/tag/txteagle/\" title=\"txteagle\" target=\"_blank\">Nathan Eagle&apos;s</a> work in crowd sourcing language translation and health in a similar way for education? pay the students to learn.&nbsp; It&apos;s not to suggest they need motivation, but rather access.&nbsp; Pay off the phone and air time by answering questions correctly, and then move on.</p>\n<p>Why not? If you think about investment in the long term, creating access and empowering young people to become educated, indeed self educated of sorts, would pay handsomely down the road. If you consider the vast amounts of money invested in ICT Development why not start the funding at the bottom and let it grow? What&apos;s the financial model?

By using emerging technologies we actively combine a constructivist and connectivist philosophy of learning.&nbsp; We construct our Personal Learning Plan by defining our streams, our networks of followers and hashtags-- by connecting ideas, people, links and actions in our learning journey, which we as learners actively pursue on line and off.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 115%;\"><a name=\"h.i31qrzlgj9jj\"></a>What is a #Hashtag?</h3>\n<p><em>The </em><em># symbol, called a hashtag, is used to mark the </em><em>keyword or topic in a Tweet.

Go ahead and create one of those if you haven&rsquo;t. Delicious organizes my tags, my meta language.

Let&rsquo;s use the tag and see what we learned. I would enjoy keeping the #FLC11 tag alive for awhile and you can experiment with it and this group of people. It would be great to have everyone say something about the conference, tweet it using this hashtag and see if it goes anywhere. I hope that we have made some good new contacts for our Personal Learning Networks. &nbsp;Let me know if this takes off for you.

Give some thought to your profile, use keywords that reflect your passions. This connects you to people who share your passions and interests.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I like the mash-up approach for an LMS, --What works in <strong>this</strong> situation;&nbsp; the emphasis is on the learning.&nbsp;&nbsp; I see this as an experiential, hands-on and student empowered approach to learning. By using emerging technologies we actively combine a constructivist and connectivist philosophy of learning.&nbsp; We construct our Personal Learning Plan by defining our streams, our networks of followers and hashtags-- by connecting ideas, people, links and actions in our learning journey, which we as learners actively pursue on line and off.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 115%;\"><a name=\"h.i31qrzlgj9jj\"></a>What is a #Hashtag?</h3>\n<p><em>The </em><em># symbol, called a hashtag, is used to mark the </em><em>keyword or topic in a Tweet.

Let&rsquo;s use the tag and see what we learned. I would enjoy keeping the #FLC11 tag alive for awhile and you can experiment with it and this group of people. It would be great to have everyone say something about the conference, tweet it using this hashtag and see if it goes anywhere. I hope that we have made some good new contacts for our Personal Learning Networks. &nbsp;Let me know if this takes off for you.

We have a saying in theater: &apos;you are only as good as your last show.&apos;&nbsp; It cuts both ways, but inspires you to go on, to do your best, to be the best all the time. No humiliation. Much like self assessment--you are your harshest critic. I always ask students what they think they deserve for a grade-- you can tell right away, and usually they are much harder graders than I am. Well, I don&apos;t believe in grades anyway--I want to see growth, confidence, the assimilation of knowledge.\n<img alt=\"Maintenance\" height=\"640\" src=\"http://getfile9.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-06-17/fvmBGxDhrzdajpsrmemErtHxcqoFodvfqjnpGGdvxEmgFsvAIztjBymJacos/Maintenance.JPG.scaled500.jpg\" width=\"478\" /> </p>\n	\n</p> <p><a href=\"http://blogasaurus.posterous.com/stealth-assessment-authentic-tests\">Permalink</a>  	| <a href=\"http://blogasaurus.posterous.com/stealth-assessment-authentic-tests#comment\">Leave a comment&nbsp;&nbsp;&raquo;</a> </p>\n   ',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(340,0,0,'The Creative (Dance) Economy is Alive and Well in Lamoille County, Vermont ','text/html','http://blogasaurus.posterous.com/57032481',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,42,'\n    <p>\n	\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dibden Center for the Arts kicked off its summer season with 4 local Dance Studios presenting their end of season finales.&nbsp; The Enchanted Woods Wellness Center <a href=\"http://enchantedwoodswellness.com/\">http://enchantedwoodswellness.com/</a> &nbsp;of Morrisville, Artistic Director Alexis George Owen; Ballet Wolcott, of Wolcott, <a href=\"http://www.balletwolcott.com/\">http://www.balletwolcott.com/</a>, which is a &ldquo;collaboration between three women, Helene Nilsen, Brandy Ofciarcik-Perez, and Avi Waring&rdquo;; Stowe Dance Academy, <a href=\"http://stowedance.com/\">http://stowedance.com/</a> &nbsp;Helena Sullivan Director; &nbsp;and <strong>The Ballet School of Vermont</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.theballetschoolonline.com/\">http://www.theballetschoolonline.com/</a> formerly &lsquo;The Ballet School and Dance Arts&rsquo; with Maryellen Vickery Artistic Director.&nbsp; The growth of these studios has been very exciting to watch over the last decade, with Ballet Wolcott reviving the former Wolcott Ballet which was featured in the Smithsonian Magazine in 1995 <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/ballet-abstract.html#ixzz1PAK30uQC\">http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/ballet-abstract.html#ixzz1PAK30uQC</a></p>\n<p>Attendance for these events drew 3700 people to Johnson State College&rsquo;s fabulous Dibden Center for the Arts.&nbsp; Featuring around 460 dancers, and including the occasional paid professional, including recent NYC transplant Lighting Designer Jeffery Salzberg <a href=\"http://www.jeffsalzberg.com/\">http://www.jeffsalzberg.com/</a> who did a great job lighting <em>Sleeping Beauty </em>for The Ballet School&mdash;these studios demonstrate the health and vitality of a sector that is rarely acknowledged for its financial and educational benefits to a community.&nbsp; The Studio Directors push the barre higher every year.&nbsp; The dedication and professionalism of the dancers is inspiring to watch.</p>\n<p>\n<img alt=\"Sta_beauty\" height=\"640\" src=\"http://getfile6.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-06-13/FbDnozrqsxcFEsysukEDwgcqoaGtsldvfbxCwyaDBlibtzrgIjltbettgAmH/STA_Beauty.JPG.scaled500.jpg\" width=\"478\" />\n<img alt=\"St_albans_sleeping_beauty_\" height=\"640\" src=\"http://getfile1.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-06-13/lhCAxckzrhnkcrhFykgiEbumwkrAjuFasacekzfxobCyBFipvgxhlGaBCiHz/St_Albans_Sleeping_Beauty_.JPG.scaled500.jpg\" width=\"478\" />\n<a href=\"http://blogasaurus.posterous.com/57032481\">See the full gallery on Posterous</a> </p>\n<p>There are really no good studies of this sector that I am aware of&mdash;but a recent study by The Ontario Arts Council <a href=\"http://www.spotlightfestival.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=2348\">http://www.spotlightfestival.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=2348</a> &nbsp;found tremendous health and a significant contribution to Ontario&rsquo;s Creative Economy from the dance sector, engaging over 500,000 audience members and &nbsp;employing over 4000 dancers &nbsp;and related occupations in the region.&nbsp; Of the 20 dance companies surveyed revenues accounted for $54 million in 2008.</p>\n<p>The report &ldquo;Advancing Vermont&rsquo;s Creative Economy by the Vermont Council on Culture and Innovation <a href=\"http://www.ksefocus.com/vcci_report.pdf\">http://www.ksefocus.com/vcci_report.pdf</a> &nbsp;offers a peek at the vitality of the creative sector in Vermont.

The arts are no less suseptible to this.

What is technology? What is Dance? What is Film? What is Music?&nbsp; What is visual art or Painting? They are blending.

homogenize people and ideas. The arts are no less suseptible to this. User generated content and the internet&apos;s explosion of resources and opportunites brings me to wonder if there aren&apos;t opportunities in what we consider the \"Arts\" to be. If we re envision these silos and see the blending and emergence of new forms of media as offering us the chance to by pass the limited view of a juxstapostion of these disciplines-- suddenly the world looks different. What is technology? What is Dance? What is Film? What is Music?&nbsp; What is visual art or Painting? They are blending. The boundaries are getting fuzzy.&nbsp; Here is a young student of mine working in these new areas.

I am challenging myself to envision the world with 100 gigabytes download speed, here in every house in Vermont.&nbsp; I see some big changes possible with education, which I started to get at in my last post.&nbsp; The excitement is that with unfettered access to the internet the world&apos;s on line repositories of knolwedge and the global brain are there to help you learn anything you want. Anything. Anytime. For example, a network of micro grids makes much more sense than a mega grid for our electricity generation, distribution and uses.&nbsp; The technology and resources are there to create your own micro grid and be liberated from the constraints of the power companies. In many cases this is possible. I envision the smart grid as the web 2.0 of electricity. In other words, that user generated power is the future.&nbsp; The cost of the power lost in transmission along monolithic networks are precisely the savings we can leverage to decentralize our grid.&nbsp; This democratization of power is part of the paradigm shift accompanying the transition to the digital age, and a component of what it means to have ubiquitous broadband here, or anywhere for that matter.</p>\n<p>But think about simple day to day commerce. Instead of each household going out to buy individual items, things are ordered all on line and a delivery service stops by as needed.&nbsp; This makes much more sense than endless trips to the store; instead, fleets of energy efficient delivery vehicles routed through a GPS system would be making their rounds.&nbsp; More people would be working from home, perhaps tending gardens or creating other localized enterprises, perhaps participating in their children&apos;s education.&nbsp; Travelling would be special, not a commute. This reduces emissions and wear and tear on the roads.</p>\n<p>I see a dynamic between a hyperlocal intensification of&nbsp; the value and understanding of location and a global connectedness that is always learning, being exposed to diversity and new ideas.

I am challenging myself to envision the world with 100 gigabytes download speed, here in every house in Vermont.&nbsp; I see some big changes possible with education, which I started to get at in my last post.&nbsp; The excitement is that with unfettered access to the internet the world&apos;s on line repositories of knolwedge and the global brain are there to help you learn anything you want. Anything. Anytime. For example, a network of micro grids makes much more sense than a mega grid for our electricity generation, distribution and uses.&nbsp; The technology and resources are there to create your own micro grid and be liberated from the constraints of the power companies. In many cases this is possible. I envision the smart grid as the web 2.0 of electricity. In other words, that user generated power is the future.&nbsp; The cost of the power lost in transmission along monolithic networks are precisely the savings we can leverage to decentralize our grid.&nbsp; This democratization of power is part of the paradigm shift accompanying the transition to the digital age, and a component of what it means to have ubiquitous broadband here, or anywhere for that matter.</p>\n<p>But think about simple day to day commerce. Instead of each household going out to buy individual items, things are ordered all on line and a delivery service stops by as needed.&nbsp; This makes much more sense than endless trips to the store; instead, fleets of energy efficient delivery vehicles routed through a GPS system would be making their rounds.&nbsp; More people would be working from home, perhaps tending gardens or creating other localized enterprises, perhaps participating in their children&apos;s education.&nbsp; Travelling would be special, not a commute. This reduces emissions and wear and tear on the roads.</p>\n<p>I see a dynamic between a hyperlocal intensification of&nbsp; the value and understanding of location and a global connectedness that is always learning, being exposed to diversity and new ideas. The content that we create as we live our lives in our specific location is like the water beneath our feet and flowing around us. Our content is, like our water, our most precious resource. Is it being bottled and sold? Our media is as vulnerable.&nbsp; Equally our participation in the emerging global web is what defines and adds value to our unique content.

Complimenting the virtual aspects of place are the mixed media and events occurring hyper locally.Â  &quot;This intersection of imagined and constructed space, immersed within a locality that is mirrored through a wider media ecology is the dimension I am interested in&quot;, says Pausanius.<p /> We will stay tuned for late breaking developments--best of luck Pausanius!<p />Reported by Virtual Dude, Reactiongrid, Ontos2--somewhere in the cloud.<p /> <p>\n<a href=\"http://getfile2.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/blogasaurus/nvdTG9Dip9trHp4eU3I5RnPKgyMInt8CaD1z0VtWtjwhLrZSTQPKhcOCUfSe/Dibden_Ontos2_001.png.scaled.1000.jpg\"><img alt=\"Dibden_ontos2_001\" height=\"298\" src=\"http://getfile1.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/blogasaurus/fZLUPQKnZNDcODuTfwnYd5IQFgG3bBM0P5DdQrX3sgoiUhOg1mCJkoE0n2YX/Dibden_Ontos2_001.png.scaled.500.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a>\n<a href=\"http://getfile7.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/blogasaurus/RQaqHVQvDpZGujS76cOjTh3LENnlgjBE1ndamzLjpcbjNA1D5OA3mMZIabcx/Dibden_Ontos2_002.png.scaled.1000.jpg\"><img alt=\"Dibden_ontos2_002\" height=\"298\" src=\"http://getfile6.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/blogasaurus/hlVpxXStWxmiPWVBYwLk3fV2VSylvFMh9FX1YEBXmdZwwKYxRkpha02gWzbp/Dibden_Ontos2_002.png.scaled.500.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a>\n<a href=\"http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/blogasaurus/CCLk3E8kUBiAk2KaONHZ1wnkJngegCtpoLcxUPOeOt82hggOHVzKOAGBolyJ/Dibden_Ontos2_003.png.scaled.1000.jpg\"><img alt=\"Dibden_ontos2_003\" height=\"298\" src=\"http://getfile2.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/blogasaurus/w2QMLQs4lmWzUkKBAKSTphDGsiSZ7yGspCg0dpl5EpcIiH7aY9Lx252aXv8Q/Dibden_Ontos2_003.png.scaled.500.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a>\n<a href=\"http://getfile9.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/blogasaurus/XkIl9KRnv6U9VyBnMcg3aCgzp6EnvzETQo1ChawNiBI0Emy3d6WaYsNVH4TR/Dibden_Ontos2_004.png.scaled.1000.jpg\"><img alt=\"Dibden_ontos2_004\" height=\"298\" src=\"http://getfile8.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/blogasaurus/mrZclv3fEl9w3OlNGvxJIWeBXX2yM3kZTtBWuKITyM5OZ2uj19666hQn12i0/Dibden_Ontos2_004.png.scaled.500.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a>\n<a href=\"http://getfile4.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/blogasaurus/1aBVfd7y0ABUaN1emr9h5dL2sngOclZbtljd4oJoM2NTmYDoSJ7HOk9hdVzB/Dibden_Ontos2_005.png.scaled.1000.jpg\"><img alt=\"Dibden_ontos2_005\" height=\"298\" src=\"http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/blogasaurus/mciI7007K7WOukg2yVtuSaQp8a1V7heC9ErHR1U73JbUpVTIWGpA1GNzffjW/Dibden_Ontos2_005.png.scaled.500.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a>\n<a href=\"http://getfile9.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/blogasaurus/I2wD9jF1IvjFpCCqyFpnRers0IDWWvZ8e24PHfXDmU0DLAuTJgeReEosaboI/Dibden_Ontos2_006.png.scaled.1000.jpg\"><img alt=\"Dibden_ontos2_006\" height=\"298\" src=\"http://getfile8.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/blogasaurus/6vBO5wfFieWT1TS3X4uoSWYLOQC8dE8yLxoOCmj3xoYQ3PJzm2T8BNmUgzLo/Dibden_Ontos2_006.png.scaled.500.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a>\n<a href=\"http://getfile5.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/blogasaurus/lWy9rI2dv0Udxs6eiXs2sQJAIWpqOjO8C7QpA53cnGTzU0NX84NSehkJJ4vF/Dibden_Ontos2_007.png.scaled.1000.jpg\"><img alt=\"Dibden_ontos2_007\" height=\"298\" src=\"http://getfile4.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/blogasaurus/wA839a0Cnbljmh6PqyjDTScscfGRbD83Hvap4zG5DNCqmDPnGviO4qVskMxy/Dibden_Ontos2_007.png.scaled.500.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a>\n<a href=\"http://blogasaurus.posterous.com/construction-on-virtual-dibden-in-reactiongri\">See the full gallery on Posterous</a> </p>\n	\n</p> <p><a href=\"http://blogasaurus.posterous.com/construction-on-virtual-dibden-in-reactiongri\">Permalink</a>  	| <a href=\"http://blogasaurus.posterous.com/construction-on-virtual-dibden-in-reactiongri#comment\">Leave a comment&nbsp;&nbsp;&raquo;</a> </p>\n   ',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(348,0,0,'The timeline','text/html','http://feefihohum.wordpress.com/2012/09/14/the-timeline/','Uncategorized;Oped12',NULL,NULL,25,NULL,NULL,NULL,43,'A bit baffled by this xtimeline &#8211;

advertise class blogs through your own;\n</li>\n<li>\nbe a guest blogger on a classroom blog â€“ help the cause with some of your insights to a classroom topic;\n</li>\n<li>\nlet the class interview you on a topic and have them post the interview;\n</li>\n<li>\ntake your smartphone for a walk and do a scavenger hunt of the school and have the students explore and discover;\n</li>\n<li>\ntake your smartphone and show images of the monthly theme â€“ let the kids share their thoughts;\n</li>\n<li>do a show and tell, bring and brag, at the next parents&apos; group meeting;</li>\n<li>create and share a webquest via blog post &#8211; you&#8217;re passionate about something;</li>\n<li>go through that filing cabinet and turn your great lessons into lessons to be shared with others;</li>\n<li>\nyou were a teacher before &#8211; what can you pay back to the profession?\n&#8230;\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"left\">We talk about the need for kids to be \"Google-able\".Â  What about you?Â  If the only results are your name on the front page of a school or district or perhaps embedded in a copy of the minutes of a meeting, it&apos;s time that you up your game.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">With a bit of effort, you can push the innovation process along.Â  Today it&apos;s blogging;

Interestingly, they don&apos;t even ask others to review their work, even though they know it&apos;s super easy to do so.</p>\n<p>I have also used Google Docs to collaborate on province-wide writing projects. The ability to add comments specifically directed (and emailed) to certain authors (by pre-pending + to the email address of the author) makes it a very powerful and effective tool.</p>\n<p>Your idea about collaborating on a lesson plan is an excellent one, but it&apos;s something that I have never seen done outside of sponsored, paying writing jobs.

Students embark on a scientific exploration based on the scientific<br />\nmethod. Each student selects his or her topic of study, conducts a KWL (what you<br />\nknow, what you want to know, what you learn), and establishes a research question and<br />\nhypothesis.<br />\nâ€¢ Acceptable/Responsible Use Policy is discussed and signed by each participating<br />\nstudent.<br />\nâ€¢ The project is positioned within the following perspective. What if your teachers<br />\ndisappeared and you had to learn on your own? Would you give up on learning? Where<br />\nwould you begin? Why would learning be important? You are an empowered learner.<br />\nYou have the power to learn anything. How much you learn is up to you. How you<br />\nmanage your learning is up to you. How you manage your time is up to you.

While they are still popular and widely shared, many people feel that they are being over-produced and often lazily executed. That said, an infographic can still be widly successful on many levels if done right and organized strategically where the audience benefits from the information and story you are telling. From my experience in producing several widely shared infographics for MBA@UNC, here are five tips on how to create a great infographic:&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"diigo-tags\">     tags:           <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/tips\">tips</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/creating\">creating</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/infographic\">infographic</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/people\">people</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/to read\">to read</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/social\">social</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/social media\">social media</a>      <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/dougpete/media\">media</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"diigo-link\">        <a href=\"http://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-fixes-ie-security-hole-another-update-on-friday\">Microsoft fixes IE security hole; another update on Friday &#8211; Neowin</a>   </p>\n<p class=\"diigo-description\">&#8220;Microsoft has moved quickly to fix an exploit that was discovered a few days ago in some versions of its Internet Explorer web browser.

Â While at the event, we agreed upon the need for global connections, but we both could see the need to push for something uniquely Ontario. Â This fall, Shannon assumes the role of Principal at <a href=\"http://glencairnps.ca/\">Glen Cairn Public School </a>in the Ottawa Carleton District School Board. Â I used this as an opportunity to interview her as she makes this big, exciting move.</p>\n<p>Doug: Â Congratulations on the appointment to Principal at Glen Cairn. Â This must be an exciting time for you.</p>\n<p>Shannon: Â Thanks, Doug. Â This is indeed a very exciting time for me. Â I am still amazed at how lucky I am to be a Principal in a really progressive district here in Ontario. Â </p>\n<p>Doug: Â Your background is strong as a Special Education teacher before entering administration. Â What unique attributes do you bring to the school because of this?</p>\n<p>Shannon: Â That is a tough one because I cannot imagine any educator not having the same high level of commitment to every student &#8211; those who struggle as well as those for whom school comes easily. Â I can say that having a daughter with a developmental disability drew me to Special Education and I think that she has had a greater impact on my philosophy than any level of specialist training I hold. Â </p>\n<p>Having said that, as a Special Education teacher, you are afforded many opportunities to work with families who are going through difficult times. Â Every single time I sit with a family who is learning, perhaps for the first time, that their child is \"different\" from typical children, I am keenly aware of what that experience can feel like. Â I have learned so much from sitting and listening to parents as they share their fears, their hopes and their love for their child. Â </p>\n<p>Doug: Â A while back, I had written the post \"<a href=\"http://dougpete.wordpress.com/2012/03/22/your-school-doesnt-need-a-newsletter/\">Your School Doesn&apos;t Need a Newsletter</a>\". Â When I visit the Glen Cairn website, I see icons for Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, Pinterest, and YouTube. Â is this a sign that you&apos;re prepared to go paperless?</p>\n<p>Shannon: Â Glen Cairn PS had made some moves towards less paper before my arrival. Â They did away with agendas in favour of online homework calendars (google) and a few teachers already have blogs. Â I will still send home paper notices from time to time, but I do plan to rely quite heavily on digital means for communication. Â We are using our blog and those other services you mention, as well as weekly synrevoice messages (email and automated phone calls). Â After speaking with staff at GCPS, I discovered that a very small percentage of families do not have access to the internet at home and this is why I plan to use a combination of paper and digital communication.</p>\n<p>The more important shift for me is from broadcast only to two-way communication. Â Digital communication facilitates this, if used effectively. Â The caveat is that communication with the learning community must invite participation. Â Using blogs and social media will only be \"old wine in new bottles\" if we don&apos;t also shift to engaging in dialogue. Â It is not enough to broadcast what you are doing. Â We know that parents play a key role in supporting learning, and so whatever choices I make around communication channels, I must look for ways to draw the community into discussions and decision-making.</p>\n<p>Doug: Â Related to this, do you see eBooks and electronic textbooks in Glen Cairn&apos;s future?</p>\n<p>Shannon: Â Great question. Â GCPS is about to transition from a K &#8211; 8 school to a middle school next year. Â There are many decisions to be made and I intend to have staff involved in making decisions related to our future. Â Personally, I like to offer a variety of types of learning materials. Â I don&apos;t feel a huge need for e-textbooks because I think that textbooks are too linear and limited. Â I would prefer to spend that money on teachers &#8212; supporting staff who want to try new approaches, acquire tools that they will use meaningfully with students. Â If someone wants to try something new, I want to be in a position to support that.</p>\n<p>Doug: Â Glen Cairn is located in the heart of Kanata, one of Canada&apos;s high technology centres. Â Does this put extra importance on the use of technology effectively at the school?</p>\n<p>Shannon: Â I don&apos;t know if it puts additional importance, but it may mean that we have some parents who are quite accustomed to using technology in innovative ways. Â It is critical that we foster digital literacy within our students, regardless of where the school is situated.</p>\n<p>Doug: Â Is or will Glen Cairn be a BYOT school? Â What do you see as the possibilities for this? Â Is there a concern that some students will not bring technology of their own to school?</p>\n<p>Shannon: Â Students in intermediate grades will have the opportunity to use their own technology at school. Â This is our first year with wireless, so there is going to be a learning curve. Â If students are unable to bring technology, they will not be left out because we will make it a priority to ensure that everyone has access. Â Stay tuned as we move into BYOD!</p>\n<p>Doug: Â There may come a time when you add additional staff members to your school. Â How important is a strong technical background coming into the position?</p>\n<p>Shannon: Â I will be adding many new staff members next year, as we are projected to double in size when we transition to being a middle school. Â You can bet that a strong interest and comfort level with technology will be an asset. Â I will be looking for teachers who are master learners first and foremost. Â I have already begun conversations with staff members who will stay when we make the change to explore what strengths we already have and what gaps will need to be filled. Â For instance, we have an instrumental music teacher and a Core French teacher with a strong Visual Arts background. Â We will be looking for individuals with strong backgrounds in Math, Literacy, Science and Physical Education. Â We intend to link with our neighbouring High School whenever possible and I believe that a solid comfort level with connective technologies will play a key role in that relationship.</p>\n<p>Doug: Â Will you do a Social Media \"check\" of applicants?</p>\n<p>Shannon: Â I will pay added attention to individuals who highlight a positive digital footprint in their application. Â I have pondered the \"check\" quite a bit and I don&apos;t think at this time that I would do that. Â I must admit though, that I do expect an applicant to have spent some time researching the school online and to be able to articulate, based on what he or she finds, how she or he will compliment the school team.</p>\n<p>Doug: Â I note that the Glen Cairn website is created using WordPress whereas other OCDSB websites are templates from Sharepoint. Â What do you see as the advantage of a web presence this way?</p>\n<p>Shannon: Â Nice catch! Â I am a wordpress gal. Â I tried google sites this summer and just couldn&apos;t get the site to do what I wanted. Â I want strong social integration. Â I want it to look pretty and I want it to be very accessible. Â I have to admit I don&apos;t know much about the inner workings of Sharepoint, but I found the template very limiting. Â I like easy and seamless.</p>\n<p>Doug: Â One of my favourite Ontario blogs has always been \"ShannonInOttawa\". Â You&apos;ve been very transparent with your learnings there. Â Will that continue? Â Will there be a \"ShannonThePrincipalInOttawa\" blog instead?</p>\n<p>Shannon: Thanks, Doug. Â I will keep with ShannoninOttawa, although I anticipate many cross-posts to <a href=\"http://glencairnps.ca/\">http://glencairnps.ca</a> because I intend to share my personal learnings there too. Â I think that posting my own learning on the school blog might engage parents, students and staff in conversations about learning. Â I also think that when I share about my own learning, I model what I expect of all members of the school community. Â I will look for feedback and pushback too, although I know it will likely take some time for community members to feel safe engaging in those conversations online. Â </p>\n<p>Doug: Â In your new position, you will not have the assistance of a vice-principal. Â Can your use of technology help with this? Â How?</p>\n<p>Shannon: Yes! Â In a sense I am filling two positions this year &#8211; principal and vice-principal. Â Within those roles I wear many other hats. Â I rely heavily on technology to keep me organized, to help me stay current in my professional reading and lead the instructional program, and to build relationships and communicate with my community. Â </p>\n<p>I stay organized with a google calendar. Â My husband is also a Principal in our District and we have two children (Violet is 12 and Donovan is 10). Â We have swimming lessons, skating, dancing, skiing. Â We have 2 staff meetings and 2 parent council meetings every month. Â I also have many meetings with parents, community members and professionals every week, as well as District PLCs and operations meetings. Â The google calendar is indispensable. Â </p>\n<p>I subscribe to many blog feeds with my google reader and I check it from time to time to stay current on what others are saying about education around the world. Â I use Diigo to bookmark and share great finds on the web and I also use twitter to share. Â That way, I can go back and find the gems when I want to reference them, either in a blog post, or a PD session with staff or community.</p>\n<p>I blog to share and solicit feedback on my thinking and vision. Â I think that adopting a stance of openness has given me some initial credibility within the GCPS learning community. Â I hope that as we head into a fairly large change process, that trust will continue to grow. Â I expect push back too, because that is all part of engaging in honest dialogue. Â And while the face to face conversations are real, connections that happen withÂ Social media can be a great starting point.</p>\n<p>Doug: Â You&apos;ve been a leadership voice in the Connected Principals initiative. Â <a href=\"http://connectedprincipals.com/\">http://connectedprincipals.com/</a> Â Now that you&apos;ll be attending principals meetings and professional learning opportunities, do you see the Ottawa Carleton influence growing?</p>\n<p>Shannon: Â I hope so. Â There are many leaders in the OCDSB beginning to \"get\" the benefits of connected learning and leadership. Â I believe that we are about to see a \"tipping point\" within leadership across the province as more school leaders realize the power of harnessing technology across all domains of leadership, from instruction to relationship building.</p>\n<p>Doug: Â Bizarre as it may seem this early in your stint, there will come a time when you move from Glen Cairn. Â In the sentence, \"We remember Mrs. Smith when she was principal. Â She was responsible for ...&#8230;\", how would you like to complete that sentence?</p>\n<p>Shannon: \"... helping us to have a smooth transition to a middle school environment\". Â That is my priority at this point.</p>\n<p>Doug: Â One last question &#8212; you&apos;re speaking at the ECOO Conference in October. Â Can you give us a preview and inspiration to circle your sessions on our calendars?</p>\n<p>Shannon: Â I will be speaking in two different sessions. Â The first is called, \"Innovation or Novelty?\" and it will be a lively discussion amongst participants, co-hosted by my husband, Brent Smith (@OttawaBrent). Â Our aim is to tease out some of our beliefs around the role of technology with regards to fostering innovation, creativity and critical thinking in schools. Â What role does tinkering play in the classroom? Â Is there a space for playing around, or should we be demanding more rigour in our learning environments? Â </p>\n<p>For the second session I will join Brian Harrison (@bharrisonp) to explore how we can use personal devices to capture, document and celebrate learning. Â This session will look at how we can provide timely feedback to students and parents and streamline some of our assessment practices using smartphones and other \"pocket\" technologies.</p>\n<p>Doug: Â Thanks for your time and your thoughts.

For me, the combination of emails not arriving, no blogs to engage with, inaccessible readings and the fact that I was on holiday meant that I didn&#8217;t really engage much last week. I am hoping to make up for that this week. </p>\n<p>A significant part of my interest in taking this MOOC was to experience the tools for this type of course and online peer learning in a more focused way that in my usual PLN which is based around Google plus and Twitter. So this week I really want to read other people&#8217;s blogs and make some comments, but first I want to do some more reading.</p>\n<p>Talking of tools, I am trying to do this whole thing digitally on my Android tablet so am starting with the readings that are downloadable as pdfs because these I can easily annotate with <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=udk.android.reader&amp;hl=en\">EZpdf reader</a> which seems the &#8216;natural&#8217; way for me to engage with a text. I realise this is very rooted in my experience as a student in the 90s when scribbling on photocopies of chapters and papers was the most common way to work in my discipline area (literature and gender studies). When I have done the pdf readings it will be interesting to see how I can engage with Web-based readings. This is important for me to think about because in my day to day practice as an education developer I am frequently referring colleagues to Web pages (including ones I have created) without thinking too much about how the &#8216;reading&#8217; of such resources might differ from more traditional reading such as journal articles (though of course these too are often online these days).<br />\nLater&#8230;I actually found a <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nop.urltopdf&amp;hl=en\">URL-to-pdf Android app</a> so all my reading and annotating is now happening in EZpdf reader but still want to think about how people might be reading the materials I am creating. That&#8217;s one for the to-do list!</p>\n<p>I am intrigued that the Open University is to be used as an example because much as I love the OU, which got me started on Higher Education in the 80s, I am thinking back to the rather stringent definition of &#8216;open&#8217; we read last week and am not convinced that the OU I experienced met the requirements &#8211; although there were no formal entry requirements, the fees were (even then) quite considerable and the course materials were copyrighted&#8230;.. Having now read the piece on the history of the OU I am not sure that their materials are OERs, or at least not all of them. There are some free &#8216;openlearn&#8217; courses in recent years, but I am not sure whether they are copyrighted in a restrictive way. And are open access TV programmes produced by a university any more OERs than any TV documentary?</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"www.connectivism.ca/?p=111\">Cute Kitten Syndrome blog post by Stephen Downes</a> from 4 years ago was interesting in that it still seemed relevant, suggesting that the OER movement may not actually be moving very much or very fast. Apart from the sudden glut of MOOCs there does not seem to be a rush for HEIs to produce or use a wide range of OERs. I have seen YouTube lectures which seem as much about marketing as education and examples of digitizing archive materials to improve access (which seems like great idea for opening up research to students) but, at least in the UK there does not seem to be much use of OERs in HE teaching. In all my interactions with faculty I have only come across one or two people using such resources (a lab simulation from <a href=\"http://www.merlot.org/merlot/index.htm\">MERLOT</a> and <a href=\"http://webphysics.davidson.edu/Applets/about-physlets.html\">Physlets</a>) as part of teaching practice. As both of these examples are from the hard sciences I wonder if there is a disciplinary split going on here, with digitization of archives/resources on one hand and use of simulations/learning objects on the other? I would be interested to know whether anyone else has observed a humanities/science split in the use of OERs. </p>\n<p>Now I am off to do two things. First, to read and engage with some other #oped12 blogs and second, to think a bit more about what I wanted to get from this MOOC and what it wanted me to get from it (learning outcomes) and how either of us is going to evaluate / assess that.</p>\n<br /> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/annehole.wordpress.com/144/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/annehole.wordpress.com/144/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=annehole.wordpress.com&#038;blog=38332438&#038;post=144&#038;subd=annehole&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(485,7,0,'The 60-Second Guide To Teaching With Tablets','Diigo','http://edudemic.com/2012/08/teaching-with-tablets/',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,30,'<p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=&quot;http://groups.diigo.com/group/oped12/content/tag/infographic&quot;>infographic</a>, <a href=&quot;http://groups.diigo.com/group/oped12/content/tag/tablet&quot;>tablet</a>, <a href=&quot;http://groups.diigo.com/group/oped12/content/tag/design&quot;>design</a></p><p><strong>by:</strong> <a href=&quot;http://groups.diigo.com/group/oped12/content/user/brainysmurf1234&quot; title=&quot;View Brainy Smurf&apos;s content in group&quot;>Brainy Smurf</a></p>',1348241043,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fri, 21 Sep 2012 14:48:59 -0000',NULL,'Best content in oped12 | Diigo - Groups','7',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(486,5,0,'25 Ways To Use Twitter To Improve Your Professional Development','Diigo','http://edudemic.com/2012/09/25-ways-to-use-twitter-to-improve-your-professional-development/',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,30,'<p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=&quot;http://groups.diigo.com/group/oped12/content/tag/twitter&quot;>twitter</a>, <a href=&quot;http://groups.diigo.com/group/oped12/content/tag/design&quot;>design</a>, <a href=&quot;http://groups.diigo.com/group/oped12/content/tag/networks&quot;>networks</a></p><p><strong>by:</strong> <a href=&quot;http://groups.diigo.com/group/oped12/content/user/brainysmurf1234&quot; title=&quot;View Brainy Smurf&apos;s content in group&quot;>Brainy Smurf</a></p>',1348241043,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fri, 21 Sep 2012 14:45:38 -0000',NULL,'Best content in oped12 | Diigo - Groups','5',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(487,0,0,'&#x201c;Mock MOOCS?&#x201d; Where do we fit in?

aggregate the feed from this blog among others.Â  The real diehards will have it emailed to you.Â  The random readers will pick it up with a news service like Flipboard, Zite, Pulse News, News.me, etc. But, I suspect that there&apos;s a certain element that read a Twitter message from someone and then follow a link to get over here.Â  A Retweet is easy to spot with the RT or MT in the message but there are some that are just difficult to trace.</p>\n<p>So, I know a couple of ways that the message gets out because I&apos;m the creator behind that and I&apos;m just going to guess on the rest.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, Shannon Smith gave a terrific interview about her first weeks as principal of Glen Cairn Public School in Ottawa.Â  I&apos;m really appreciative that she found the time in her busy new schedule to take the time for the interview.Â  As I write this, it&apos;s 9:30 on Friday morning and already the word has spread on Twitter about the post.Â  I did some backtracking and found what I hope are all of the mentions of the interview at this point.</p>\n<p>So, I did some screen grabs of the individual Twitter messages and put them into mural.ly to see what I could do.Â

something new is posted.Â  That&apos;s great and reaches a bigger audience.Â  All of these robots do cause some concern because one slip and they&apos;re all over it.Â  You can&apos;t recall a notice once they send it!</p>\n<p>More importantly, real people come along later in the morning.Â  However they get a notice, they&apos;re kind enough to pass along the word of the new post.Â  You&apos;ll notice that there were a few people that were good enough to do that.Â  How they got their notice eludes me but I&apos;m just thankful that they did.</p>\n<p>But enough about me â€“ back to creating the mural, er map.</p>\n<p>Once I have the screen captures as raw materials, it&apos;s a matter of drag/drop or copy/paste to put them into the workplace.Â  Tape an element and you can draw it into place.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dougpete.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/shannon.jpg\"><img

Tap to highlight getting the dots for a border around the object and you can pic it up, move it around, or rotate, resize or choose an option from the menu.</p>\n<p><a

whiteboard, you&apos;ll be right at home here.Â  In fact, this may well be your primary memory mapping utility to actually use on your IWB.</p>\n<p>A menu along the left of the screen provides flyouts for the types of actions that you&apos;ll use when editing your mural.Â  In this case, I&apos;ve flown out a sample of the stickers that are available.</p>\n<p><a

There is a show/presentation mode that let you present your ideas to an audience.Â  I found that there&apos;s a really nice selection of tools to do everything that I could think of with a memory map.Â  When you first create a document, you have a choice of public or private which is nice.Â  In fact, I think that most people start private until it gets ready for show time and then make it public or at least provide a link to the document.</p>\n<p>Mural.ly shows its suggested workflow as you log in.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dougpete.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mural1.jpg\"><img

really get a sense of the power in this tool.Â  There are a good selection of options for sharing once you do decide to go live...</p>\n<p><a

Â I&#8217;m sure your interest in sharing comes from a kind-hearted place but I&#8217;m not awake yet and the last thing I need is someone barging into my quiet little cubicle in this open office while I&#8217;m trying to gather my thoughts and get organized to start my day. Â I don&#8217;t bounce out of bed all joyful about the world and its potential. Â I&#8217;m cautious, reserved and I&#8217;m saving my limited time and energy for my handful of priorities, which I have spent considerable time sorting out before I even walked in here today.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t like spewing my personal stuff at work, anyway. Â I&#8217;m very private and very mindful of others who may be listening, for whom my life is none of their business. Â I wish you would notice and respect that about me. Â Your need to interact and share everything is *not* more important than my need for quiet and privacy. Â Being on is as life-affirming for you as being off is for me.</p>\n<p>Please percolate on that.</p>\n<p>Slow down, digest it, figure out what it means *for me* and for the other introverts in your personal and professional life. Â Otherwise, don&#8217;t be surprised when I (we) come off as dismissive, cold, uninterested or whatever other negative attributions you want to assign to my (our) reactions.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want to be rude to you. Â I don&#8217;t want to debate or explain or validate what you need when you come running in here. Â This is about what I need and, with increasing velocity and determination lately, I am taking charge of my needs and not accepting any less.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a really good listener, I know that. Â You probably know that, too, and that&#8217;s why you seem eager to see me and tell me everything that&#8217;s going on in your fast-paced life that can appear overly dramatic to me. Â You know I&#8217;m patient. Â You know I&#8217;m analytical and excellent at synthesizing so I may offer some insights that you haven&#8217;t been able to figure out yet. Â Please, just step back for a sec and realize that you&#8217;re coming at me full of *your* needs: your need to &#8216;get high&#8217; on connecting, your need to crank yourself up for the day, your need to be heard, your stories, your boundless energy.</p>\n<p>What about my need for space, for time to reflect, for being asked questions that have depth and meaning? Â Oh wait, I forgot to explain that upfront: I don&#8217;t enjoy casual chit-chat. Â  It&#8217;s a waste of my time. Â It doesn&#8217;t offer me anything I haven&#8217;t heard a thousand times already on the bus, in the street, on the news or on the web.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m bored by repetition and superficiality. Â Give me something golden to run with, a problem to solve or some dots to connect, something that respects the value of my time and my unique contribution. See if you could come to me for me, not for you.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m private. Â I&#8217;m a tough nut to crack. Â You have to earn the keys to the safe.</p>\n<p>Could you please come to me and stick with what *I* was talking about, not shifting back to you mid-sentence, and maybe we&#8217;ll both get what we need more often? Â I see you making this enormous effort to try and ask me more about me sometimes and the fact that you have to try so very hard and then can&#8217;t stick with it makes the whole interaction distasteful and tiring. Â I don&#8217;t know what to do about that. Â I&#8217;ve tried to talk to you about it, when I could get a word in edgewise, but it doesn&#8217;t seem to change anything so I withdraw a little further.</p>\n<p>I now know, from reading up on <a href=\"http://www.thepowerofintroverts.com\" target=\"_blank\">the power of introverts</a>, that it&#8217;s not natural for you to be aware of these intricacies of human interaction and quality conversation, to pick up on all the non-verbal cues and read between the lines. Â You weren&#8217;t born that way and you may not have been given the constructive feedback needed to develop these skills as you matured because you could always find like-minded extraverts to play with or other introverts who would listen more patiently, whether they genuinely wanted to or not.</p>\n<p>You like shiny things, fun things, and all this meta-analytical awareness and attention to detail bores you to tears and makes you tired. Â I get that. Â I&#8217;m the one who picks up on this stuff, remember? Â What&#8217;s changed is that I&#8217;m tired of indulging what you need. Â This ain&#8217;t about you anymore and you&#8217;re not going to like that. Â We may part ways over this and I&#8217;m okay with that now. Â I know what I need and I&#8217;m getting it elsewhere, in person and online, often asynchronously and with much greater understanding and authenticity, which feels effortless and liberating.</p>\n<p>These are exciting times for me and, consequently, I&#8217;m not as available to you as I once was. Â You know where to reach me, if and when you discover how to offer what I need and how I need it.</p>\n<p>I know this is a lot to take in. Â Thank you for making the time.</p>\n<br /> Tagged: <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/oped12/&apos;>#oped12</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/connections/&apos;>connections</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/extravert/&apos;>extravert</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/introvert/&apos;>introvert</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/742/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/742/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com&#038;blog=27959777&#038;post=742&#038;subd=brainysmurf1234&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(514,0,0,'Openness and me this week','text/html','http://maryakem.wordpress.com/2012/09/22/openness-and-me-this-week/','Uncategorized',NULL,NULL,22,NULL,NULL,NULL,38,'I continue to rush through a few jobs to working my OiE work, next month WILL be better I promise.

In the top 3 audience picks were libraries supporting rare, unique publications; digitization of local photographs on an open platform; #mooc for digital literacy for citizens from the public library.Â  I could write a paper on the politic, economics and sociology (never mind the history ; >) of open education embedded in the dialogue there.Â  Maybe I&#8217;ll do that&#8230; soon. #wishfulthinking</p>\n<p>3. I was engaged yesterday in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com//search/opendataLS\">#opendataLS</a> Open Data Learning Summit from the BC government and the BC Libraries CO-op.Â  One more heartbreaking conference where the potential of some great leap forward is envisioned within a crippling silo of likeminded people.Â  I have a really strong track record with that, which is made even stronger by participating in the business of K12 education, Higher ed, public libraries, IT service and gov&#8217;t at one turn or another over the last 18 months.Â  Like I say&#8230; heartbreaking&#8230; but still we try.</p>\n<p>I think especially of the question from the remarkable journalist and coder <a href=\"http://twitter.com/coppinr\">@coppinr</a> can libraries be aggregating data sets in the spirit of openness.Â  We didn&#8217;t admit it.. but the answer is no.Â  IT service management and libraries is more than often a disaster, library skills with collection management is something that is at odds with technical services sustainability and the tenor of datasets so although we keep saying we&#8217;ll change this any day&#8230;Â  we are NOT there yet.Â  Our service mode is sustaining too many old services to offer these new ones..</p>\n<p>Please go visit the archives&#8230;instead! Where they might be smidge better off infrastructure wise but will lack the opennesses you sense so rightly from public libraries.. or worse yet leave publics for &#8216;the university&#8217; where brand and ownership will infect datasets to their very core within minutes :<</p>\n<p>Thank youÂ  <a href=\"http://twitter.com/coppinr\">Rhiannon CoppinÂ </a> your question is so important.</p>\n<p>And a thank you too, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/haigarmen\">@haigarman</a> for his data visualization talk and math + aesthetics advocacy.Â  A wonderful after talk with him about the painful history of literacy over numeracy in the North American psyche&#8230;Â  I could probably write a thesis on &#8220;the language of instruction&#8221;

Â While there have been a few that are fans of it, the majority of the press has been negative. Â I decided to take a look myself and see how it might impact my little world. Â Mapping for the consumer is a fairly mature process. Â It&#8217;s on your smart phone, the web, your portable GPS and an option in new vehicles. Â Not only do I use it personally when going on trips to new places, it&#8217;s helped me find quicker ways to get around places that I already know about.</p>\n<p>My first steps weren&#8217;t off to a great start. Â I asked it to plot where I was &#8211; and it turned out to be half a concession away. Â That&#8217;s not a great start but at least the concession road was right. Â But, I know where I live so I guess that&#8217;s pretty much irrelevant. Â Let&#8217;s try something more serious.</p>\n<p>Like dog walking. Â One of our favourite places to go for a walk is in the heart of town and we&#8217;ll often stroll down Fort Malden Drive to see the sights. Â Uh oh.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" src=\"http://dougpete.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/2012-09-23-07-54-17.png?w=381&h=420\" alt=\"\" width=\"381\" height=\"420\" /></p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t you hate it when OCR goes wrong?

Â Maybe not deal breakers but when you can&#8217;t find an entire town? Â I decided to take a look around Huron County. Â There are five major towns there &#8211; Goderich, Clinton, Wingham, Seaforth, and Exeter. Â Sadly, only Goderich was found in the right place.</p>\n<p>This was an attempt to find Exeter, ON.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" src=\"http://dougpete.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/2012-09-23-07-55-05.png?w=519\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>When I did zoom out, I discovered I80 and further zooming out reveals this to be in Pennsylvania in a place that appears to be called West Pittston.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" src=\"http://dougpete.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/2012-09-23-15-10-19.png?w=519\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Not even close. Â I can&#8217;t even comment on whether that&#8217;s up to date or recent.</p>\n<p>So, while it may find Goderich, ON, it struck out with Exeter, ON. Â Let&#8217;s spell it out&#8230; Exeter, Ontario. Â This search does drop a pin in the right spot. Â However, I&#8217;m not so sure about their phone number or website.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" src=\"http://dougpete.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/2012-09-23-15-34-02.png?w=357&h=628\" alt=\"\" width=\"357\" height=\"628\" /></p>\n<p>But, I can tell you this. Â The town of Harrow, ON&#8217;s main intersection is County Road 11 and County Road 20. Â This map has it labelled <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Highway_18\">King&#8217;s Highway 18</a>. Â This was true &#8211; years ago until the province of Ontario gave up maintenance of highways! Â The article dates it as 1997. Â To the map&#8217;s defense, if you zoom in far enough, the road carries a double label of Highway 18 and County Road 20. Â That&#8217;s not too confusing.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" src=\"http://dougpete.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/harrow.png?w=519\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Sadly, all of this refers to places that I actually know about and wouldn&#8217;t be using a map application for anyway. Â The same tests using Google Maps provide the right content.</p>\n<p>Mapping problems have spawned all kinds of news stories of problems. Â There is even a <a href=\"http://theamazingios6maps.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr page</a> devoted to people identifying problems. Â And, there are all <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=alternatives+to+apple+maps\">kinds of alternatives</a>. Â Fortunately, I had already bookmarked the Google Maps Web Application and it was maps as usual for me. Â If you are concerned, there are some <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=alternatives+to+apple+maps\">good suggestions</a>.</p>\n<p>The unfortunate part of all this is that the implementation may also reflect badly on the partners that provide the content. Â If you turn the leaf at the bottom right corner of the screen, you can see them.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s too bad that the original Google Maps application was removed. Â It had been a good actor. Â iOS6 could even have left it alone, installed the Apple Maps application and let the end user decide which one they would ultimately use.</p>\n<p>For me, though, if I can&#8217;t trust the reliability of maps for places that I know, how can I rely on it to take me to new places? Â The programmer in me really does hope that there&#8217;s a fix on the way.</p>\n<p>But, for now, I&#8217;m going to stick to my Google Maps Web Application.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/22/mapsception/\" target=\"_blank\">How Ridiculous Is It That Apple Maps Redirect To Google Maps On The Web?</a> (techcrunch.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://r.zemanta.com/?u=http%3A//tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/09/23/why-apple-pulled-the-plug-on-google-maps/&amp;a=113895246&amp;rid=00000025-cd1f-000F-0000-000000002b5c&amp;e=2d80dfeb0ff2e8b605b8446d83178ad0\" target=\"_blank\">Why Apple pulled the plug on Google Maps</a> (tech.fortune.cnn.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://clixto7.com/?p=1531\" target=\"_blank\">Motorola takes a jab at Apple Maps</a> (clixto7.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2012/09/23/apple-maps-disaster-stems-from-lack-of-data-and-will-last-quite-some-time/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Maps disaster stems from lack of data &#8211; and will last &#8220;quite some time&#8221;</a> (venturebeat.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://counternotions.com/2012/09/21/applemaps/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Maps: The FAQ</a> (counternotions.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://articles.marketwatch.com/2012-09-21/finance/33996768_1_google-maps-apple-patents-apple-products\" target=\"_blank\">In Apple-Google maps war, consumers lose</a> (articles.marketwatch.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.pcgerms.com/how-to-get-google-maps-in-ios-6/\" target=\"_blank\">How to get Google Maps in iOS 6</a> (pcgerms.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<br /> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/dougpete.wordpress.com/11100/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/dougpete.wordpress.com/11100/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=dougpete.wordpress.com&#038;blog=2477343&#038;post=11100&#038;subd=dougpete&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(542,0,0,'http://t.co/WJzKUvl6 http://t.co/pK5CeESI','twitter','http://twitter.com/monicagrossoni/statuses/250164742994403329',NULL,NULL,NULL,342,'http://twitter.com/monicagrossoni/statuses/250164742994403329',NULL,NULL,29,'<a href=\"http://t.co/WJzKUvl6\">http://t.co/WJzKUvl6</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/pK5CeESI\">http://t.co/pK5CeESI</a>',1348483443,NULL,NULL,'monicagrossoni','http://twitter.com/monicagrossoni','Mon, 24 Sep 2012 09:28:17 +0000',NULL,'oped12 - Twitter Search',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(543,26,0,'Of kittens and tigers in open education (#oped12)','text/html','http://opendistanceteachingandlearning.wordpress.com/2012/09/24/of-kittens-and-tigers-in-open-education-oped12/','Change.mooc.ca;Oped12;accreditation;Coursera;distance education;e-learning;EdX;George Siemens;higher education;Khan Academy;OER;open distance learning;open education;Steven Pinker;Udacity;Zygmunt Bauman;',NULL,NULL,8,NULL,NULL,NULL,14,'In a blog post in 2003, George Siemens wondered whether OER, at that stage, was not just (yet another) cute kitten.Â  It is almost incomprehensible that one would find someone who does not love cute kittens, and therefore, by the &#8230; <a href=\"http://opendistanceteachingandlearning.wordpress.com/2012/09/24/of-kittens-and-tigers-in-open-education-oped12/\">Continue reading &#8594;</a><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=opendistanceteachingandlearning.wordpress.com&#038;blog=27264710&#038;post=431&#038;subd=opendistanceteachingandlearning&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',1348489683,NULL,NULL,'opendistanceteachingandlearning','http://opendistanceteachingandlearning.wordpress.com','Mon, 24 Sep 2012 11:17:27 +0000',NULL,'opendistanceteachingandlearning','20','<p><a href=\"http://opendistanceteachingandlearning.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/kittentiger.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-432\" title=\"KittenTiger\" src=\"http://opendistanceteachingandlearning.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/kittentiger.jpg?w=640&h=235\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"235\" /></a>In a blog post in 2003, George Siemens wondered <a href=\"http://www.connectivism.ca/?p=111\">whether OER, at that stage, was not just (yet another) cute kitten</a>.Â  It is almost incomprehensible that one would find someone who does not love cute kittens, and therefore, by the time of the writing his blog, it was almost unthinkable that the notion of OER would <em>not</em> be supported by educational institutions, educators and students. In this blog Siemens expresses \"a huge appreciation for OERs and hold out for the prospect that OERs will truly make a difference to people who most need them\", but he also expresses a number of concerns regarding OER such as questioning the rationale behind the move towards OER, the reality of the possibility that institutions would window dress while the basic underlying systems and structures of education would not change. Siemens (2003) also reflects on the impactÂ  of the (mostly) hidden ideologies, pedagogies and worldviews embedded in OER.</p>\n<p>After reading Siemens&#8217; (2003) blog, I wondered whether OER is still (just) a &apos;cute kitten&apos; ?Â  Is the open education movement still a nice-to-have public relations exercise or has the kitten grown up? Has the open education movement become a formidable tiger that we cannot (<em>and should not</em>) ignore? Almost nine years since Siemens&apos; (2003) blog, we need to reflect on whether the concerns he raised have been addressed, and more tentatively, what the future holds for open education.</p>\n<p>The first issue Siemens (2003) raises is questioning the rationale behind the adoption of OER. Since 2003 the opening of education has become even more en vogue with major institutions opening educational opportunities, often with accreditation. How should we understand this? There is no doubt in my mind that many of the original reasons for supporting OER are still valid. For example the need to broaden access to education and specifically to higher education has become even more important, and OER has continued to grow as a branding and marketing exercise. There is currently a flurry of higher education institutions joining these initiatives or starting their own. One of these days we may even see a new ranking system on openness with institutions trying to outdo one another on degrees of openness&#8230;</p>\n<p>Siemens (2003) also wonders whether the open education movement would be able to change <em>the basic underlying systems and structures</em> of education such as our pedagogies, our admission requirements, and our accreditation and validation systems. Â I suspect it has. However, if we consider that education throughout the ages flowed from, served and perpetuated dominant power-relations and epistemologies, the important question to consider is whether the open education movement impacted onÂ  and changed this ideological basis of education?The answer is not straightforward.</p>\n<p>Let me start with the dark side. I don&apos;t think the open education movement has made a significant or lasting difference in addressing the ideological basis of education as serving the interests of the powerful or impacted on the huge inequalities in the world â€“ on the contrary. Never before in the history of humankind have there been so many permanently disenfranchised and dislocated individuals and whole populations.Â  This is not to lay the blame on the open education movement for <em>not</em> changing all of this. We should however never <em>over</em>estimate the potential of the open education movement to address <em>and change</em> deep-seated inter-generational geopolitical and socio-economic disparities. Call me cynical but I cannot foresee education, and open education for that matter, to make a difference to the embedded gender, caste, cultural, and economic injustices characterizing many (most?) societies. I can simply not foresee that open education will make a difference to the increasing religious and national fundamentalisms resulting in millions of people being uprooted and housed in refugee camps and/or caught in geopolitical and religious claims and counter-claims.</p>\n<p>The above stands in stark contrast to the claims by, for example, Steven Pinker in his latest book \"<a href=\"http://stevenpinker.com/publications/better-angels-our-nature\">The better angels of our nature. Why violence has declined</a>\"(2011) â€“ that \"Wars between developed countries have vanished, and even in the developing world, wars kill a fraction of the people they did a few decades ago. Rape, battering, hate crimes, deadly riots, child abuse, cruelty to animals-all substantially down.\" Even if these claims were not disputed by, for example Â by <a href=\"http://www.popmatters.com/pm/column/156671-where-angels-fear-to-tread/\">Steven Aoun</a> and by <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/books/review/the-better-angels-of-our-nature-by-steven-pinker-book-review.html?pagewanted=all\">Peter Singer in the New York Times</a> (October 6, 2011), I cannot help but look at Pinker&apos;s claims from a developing world context in the Global South with increasing concerns I share with Zygmunt Bauman in his works \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Globalization-Human-Consequences-Zygmunt-Bauman/dp/023111429X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348480255&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=globalization%3A+the+human+consequences\">Globalization. The human consequences</a>\" (1998) and Â \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0745631657/ref=rdr_ext_tmb\">Wasted lives. Modernity and its outcasts</a>\" (2004).</p>\n<p>In this respect, I would say that we should not overestimate the potential of the open education movement to make a lasting and significance difference to the injustices in the world. Having said that, there is also the reality of the cute kitten that has grown up to be a formidable creature in the field of higher and distance education.Â  While cautioning against overestimating the impact of the open education movement on changing engrained intergenerational disparities, there is no doubt that the open education movement is, currently, a game changer in the field of higher and distance education.</p>\n<p>Some of the signs that the cute kitten has indeed become a formidable creature are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open content</strong> is changing the way we develop curricula. Whether those with vested interests in academic publishing will ever let go of their power-bases is something to be seen. Open content has the potential to seriously disrupt what we prescribe for our students, and what we read ourselves.</li>\n<li><strong>Open (and free) admission</strong> to the courses offered by Coursera, EdX, Udacity and the Khan Academy is making learning accessible for thousands who were previously excluded from education and higher education.</li>\n<li><strong>Open assessment and accreditation</strong> has the potential to disrupt some of the foundations of education and higher education as elitist practice. While the &apos;badges&apos; movement must still claim a space in the contested worlds of quality assurance and accreditation, the move to offering decentralised proctored examination opportunities have huge potential to dramatically alter the higher education landscape.</li>\n<li><strong>Open scholarship</strong> is increasingly becoming the preferred choice of many scholars and publishing entities.</li>\n<li><strong>OER as counter-narrative </strong>Â is addressing concerns by many in developing world contexts by which scholars in the developing world can claim legitimate spaces in the production and dissemination of knowledge and ways-of-knowing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>In conclusion:</em> The &apos;cute kitten&apos; Siemens referred to in 2003 has indeed grown up to disrupt the higher and distance education landscape. The OER movement has changed some of <em>the basic underlying systems and structures</em> of education such as our pedagogies, our admission requirements, and our accreditation and validation systems. In 2008 John Steely Brown, in the <a href=\"http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/chapters/0262033712forw1.pdf\">Foreword to \"Opening up education\"</a> wrote that we are facing an \"unrelenting velocity of change\" (p.xi).Â  Though the open education movement has, indeed, changed higher and distance education, the potential of the open education movement to make a dent in inter-generational geopolitical and socio-economic disparities must still be seen.

The students that they interact with are in their class, or their grade. The use of social media tools is limited to blogs and what the teacher deems appropriate for Â their students.</p>\n<p>The OC is developing an opportunity for students to discover opportunities for learning by collaborating with people outside of their regular classroom. They will choose whom they interact with while having a facilitator &#8220;guide on the side&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Examples of a teacher who encourages his students to connect outside of the classroom walls:</p>\n<p>Preston Learning students:<br />\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/lnsu-acmmsM\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Interview with<a href=\"https://sas.elluminate.com/site/external/jwsdetect/playback.jnlp?psid=2012-07-31.1253.M.3BBB2AFFED568E7EB37FA0573991F3.vcr&amp;sid=2008350\"> Ian and Trevor</a>Â in Blackboard Collaborate (July/12)Â about &#8220;how&#8221; students can collaborate and learn as a result of &#8220;open&#8221; environments.</p>\n<p>The prestonlearning website is down for maintenance today &#8211; but I&#8217;m hoping it work at some point -<a href=\"http://www.prestonlearning.com/\"> HERE</a></p>\n<p>2) Transparency-Â To me, transparency infers that I document, link and produce digital artifacts to publish what I am doing and thinking in an online way. Take this blog on the openclassroom as an example.</p>\n<p>Students in the Open Classroom will be encouraged to &#8220;demonstrate&#8221; how they are learning, thinking and reflecting in an online environment &#8211; being open to criticism and amazing feedback of like minded passionate people.</p>\n<p>3) Intellectual Property &#8211; The Open Classroom will be licensed with a <a href=\"Attribution-NonCommercial CC BY-NC\">Creative Commons License.</a> I think I will use theÂ <strong>Attribution-NonCommercial<br />\nCC BY-NC </strong>License because I want the created course content to be &#8220;reused&#8221; in an educational context, and not for money. What a great conversation to have with your students &#8211; how would they want their work licensed?</p>\n<p>4) Empowerment &#8211; By encouraging collaboration (new ideas), transparency (how did you find these new ideas), intellectual property (where is your voice in these these ideas?) I think that students will reach &#8220;empowerment&#8221; through open learning. Knowledge and power will be more fairly distributed &#8211; if I can ever use the word fair in Education.

button, especially ifÂ we don&#8217;t allow as much noise into our streams in the first place.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget that many of us bring to the table what our extraverted counterparts seem to lack: the natural ability to process, organize,Â synthesize and curateÂ huge quantities of detailed information.Â  By curation, I don&#8217;t meanÂ gathering every bookmark you&#8217;ve ever read.Â  I mean the detail-orientedÂ skills that include:</p>\n<p>- recognizing something as valuable</p>\n<p>- connecting it with other things that are valuable, in part or in whole</p>\n<p>- tagging the resource for easier search and retrieval at a later date</p>\n<p>- deciding where to keep the items and their tags</p>\n<p>- knowing which tools are best for curation and how to use them</p>\n<p>- sharing curation results with others</p>\n<p>- weeding out expired, duplicate, broken or irrelevant items on a regular basis</p>\n<p>Though I&#8217;m still learning about curation, I believe that I practice it fairly well and you may, too.Â  IÂ maintain my &#8216;collections&#8217; in a few different spaces as appropriate to my needs and the needs of my audience(s).Â  This includes five differentÂ email accounts (see <a href=\"http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/2012/08/16/tools-for-taming-the-email-beast/\" target=\"_blank\">Tools for Taming the Email Beast</a>), personal bookmarks, social bookmarks (<a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/user/brainysmurf1234\" target=\"_blank\">Diigo</a>), my blog, my workplace SharePoint site collection and my electronic and hard copy files at home and at work.Â  I also offer pathways between some of the locations as appropriate.Â  Let your extraverted colleagues know that you have these gifts.Â  They may welcome your guidance and may hire or promote you in order to compliment the skill sets of the extraverts on your team.</p>\n<p>I also believe that we, asÂ introverts, tend to approach new tools and events with caution and demand that they prove their worth before we invest our time and energy in them.Â  My insightful friend calls this &#8216;value for my time&#8217;.Â Â I wonder ifÂ the shiny people in our lives could benefit from developing a value-for-time filter so that they are less likely to stretch themselves thin across multiple engagements or magnetically attract the kind of energy into their lives that we label as drama or noise?</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s not forget that extraverts seem to want to play hard before working hard.Â Â Work has to be &#8216;entertaining&#8217; for them, as bizarre as that might sound to us.Â Â We might insist on diligence, throughness, disciplineÂ and work before play but that is going to be a turn-off for them and they see us as rigid and boring because of it.</p>\n<p>I know you hate this, the putting on a show and sprinkling glitter all over the drudgery.Â  It&#8217;s tiring for me, too, because it feels fake and we don&#8217;t do fake.Â Â  For extraverts,Â apparently, it&#8217;sÂ not fake.Â  It&#8217;s what genuinely gets them motivated and I guess we have to pay some attention to that if we&#8217;re going to start insisting that they pay more attention to what we need.</p>\n<p>Here are some concrete ways that we can interact with our extraverted colleagues and superiors during group events, as one extraverted colleague ofÂ mine recently noted:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">&#8220;Introverts are drained when they have to extravert for long periods of time; and extraverts are drained when they have to introvert for long periods of time.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Sharing agendas, structures, plans, etc., ahead of time will definitely support the needs of the introvert, especially if they are expected to contribute openly about their thoughts and ideas.Â  They will need and appreciate time to think things through before speaking out.Â  Extraverts, on the other hand, are very comfortable speaking and often don&apos;t need time a lot of time to express their thoughts.Â  In fact they often think as they speak, change their minds, build on what others have to say, etc. and are comfortable with this approach.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Anything we can do to help the introverts read, think, prepare before the <event> will be a win/win for everyone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Take some of these ideas to your managers, directors, facilitators and event planners, who are most likelyÂ extraverts who promote and socialize with other extraverts.Â  Ask them to respect your needs and not put you on the spot during group events.Â Â  Request a one-on-one meeting or suggest an asynchronous way to connect as an alternative or addition toÂ the group setting.Â Â  Remind them that you are a willing and cooperative team member, particularly if your ways of contributing are genuinely respected and actively offered.</p>\n<p>If we don&#8217;t start toÂ speak up for what we need, we&#8217;ll continue to be drowned out by the loudest voices of those first to the tableÂ and we&#8217;ll have no one to blame but ourselves.Â  Be strong, be brave,Â <a href=\"http://www.thepowerofintroverts.com/sixteen-things-i-believe/\" target=\"_blank\">know your own strengths</a>Â and be confident that you&#8217;re not alone inÂ seeking change, even if your voice is quieter than others.</p>\n<p>Thanks for making the time for this post and please add to it as you wish, in your own valuable ways.</p>\n<br /> Tagged: <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/oped12/&apos;>#oped12</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/change-2/&apos;>change</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/commitment/&apos;>commitment</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/connections/&apos;>connections</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/courage/&apos;>courage</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/design/&apos;>design</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/energy/&apos;>energy</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/extravert/&apos;>extravert</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/happiness/&apos;>happiness</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/introvert/&apos;>introvert</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/learning/&apos;>learning</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/networks/&apos;>networks</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/reflection/&apos;>reflection</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/risk/&apos;>risk</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/social-learning/&apos;>social learning</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/synthesizing/&apos;>synthesizing</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/time/&apos;>time</a>, <a href=&apos;http://brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/tag/vulnerability/&apos;>vulnerability</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/754/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com/754/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=brainysmurf1234.wordpress.com&#038;blog=27959777&#038;post=754&#038;subd=brainysmurf1234&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(554,0,0,'Open Learning....Principles to follow? #oped12 #vsmo&#x2026;

Additionally, it was the only MBA I&apos;d ever found that acknowledged what I&apos;ve already learned and published, providing me with credit for 6 of the 15 courses that would be required. At $2000 per course that meant saving significant money as well as time.<br />Regardless, something still kept niggling and holding me back from completing the application forms despite the fact that I am committed and passionate about lifelong learning and have always made it a priority.<br />When I analyzed my reluctance to return to learning in a formal setting, I realized that it wasn&apos;t just the time and money that was holding me back. It was more about me rebelling against the accepted model of traditional top down, instructor-centric learning.

Additionally, it was the only MBA I&apos;d ever found that acknowledged what I&apos;ve already learned and published, providing me with credit for 6 of the 15 courses that would be required. At $2000 per course that meant saving significant money as well as time.<br />Regardless, something still kept niggling and holding me back from completing the application forms despite the fact that I am committed and passionate about lifelong learning and have always made it a priority.<br />When I analyzed my reluctance to return to learning in a formal setting, I realized that it wasn&apos;t just the time and money that was holding me back.

We could quantify their number, calculate their popularity, and track their use. However, in open, distributed, networked learning environments, the emphasis is not be on the resources but on the engagement between participants who create, use, modify, and share experiences. Resources can be used to prompt and fuel conversations, and the results of one conversation can be saved and used as fuel for another, but it is the way in which they are created and used that determines their effectiveness in learning contexts. In this talk, I will use examples from several open courses to explore the nature of digital resources and discuss how they are used to enable constructive engagements between networked learners. I suggest that, although appropriate resources are an important part of the learning process, we need to pay more attention to the design of the structures and networks in which they are generated and circulated.</p>\n<p>Audio Recording (19 Minutes)</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F19761270&amp;\"></iframe>\n<iframe src=&apos;http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/13546296&apos; width=&apos;600&apos; height=&apos;492&apos;></iframe>\n<p>You can download a PDF of these slides by clicking on the link below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://markmcguire.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/oer-it_s-not-the-artifact-it_s-the-process-mark-mcguire.pdf\">OER- It&apos;s not the artifact, it&apos;s the process (Mark McGuire)</a></p>\n<br /> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/markmcguire.wordpress.com/2739/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/markmcguire.wordpress.com/2739/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=markmcguire.net&#038;blog=3044335&#038;post=2739&#038;subd=markmcguire&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(583,0,0,'National&#8217;s Budget Blunder &#8211; Increasing the quality of education by eliminating technology teachers?','text/html','http://markmcguire.net/2012/05/29/nationals-budget-blunder-increasing-the-quality-of-education-by-eliminating-technology-teachers/','Cutbacks;Dept. of Applied Sciences;Design;Dunedin;Education;News;Politics;Uncategorized;austerity;budget;Government;school;',NULL,NULL,31,NULL,NULL,NULL,48,'In their eagerness to cut costs in their recent budget, regardless of the effects, the governing National Party made a serious blunder.

These are experienced specialists who teachÂ cooking, sewing, art, ICT, woodwork and metalwork.Â FollowingÂ anÂ avalancheÂ of complaints from teachers, principals and parents, the government <a href=\"http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=10808913\" target=\"_blank\">set up a working party</a>Â in an attempt to deflect some of the criticism. Radio New Zealand continues to follow the story, <a href=\"http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/checkpoint/audio/2520224/labour,-schools&apos;-group-dismiss-class-sizes-working-group\" target=\"_blank\">reporting on the working party</a>Â yesterday (Monday, 28 May), and, this morning (Tuesday, 29 May), on the <a href=\"http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/morningreport/20120529\" target=\"_blank\">Government&#8217;s effort to backtrack</a> due to the unintended consequences of spreadsheetÂ decision making.</p>\n<p>It is very hard to see how increasing class sizes and eliminating specialist technology teachers can possibly improve the quality of education. The government may well haveÂ realizedÂ that they have made a mistake. The question now is whether they are able to correct it. The ability to learn from our mistakes, and to correct them, is one of the fundamental skills that we learn at school. Let&#8217;s see if our political leadersÂ have learned this lesson.</p>\n<p>Last night, I sent the following email to Mr Andrew Hunter, the principal of BalmacewenÂ IntermediateÂ School, where one of my two sons is a student.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dear Mr Hunter</p>\n<p>As a parent and academic in Applied Sciences,Â I am shocked to hear that the government is planning to cut the funding that currently supports the teaching of technology to Year 7 and 8 students in New Zealand. Removing specialist, experienced teachers inÂ Art, Food, Fabric and Workshop Technology clearly undermines the government&#8217;s stated objective of encouragingÂ more students to pursue a career in science and technology. Furthermore, it will limit the ability of schools to expose young learners to the broad range ofÂ disciplines andÂ experiences that enables them to develop as a whole person.</p>\n<p>By offering well-supported,Â hands-on teaching in technology subjects, intermediate schools support a thoughtful engagement with the world of physical materials, as well as with the world of ideas. They encourage students toÂ extend the capabilities of their hands as well as their mind atÂ a formative stage in their development. Understanding the properties and potentials of materials is crucial to design thinking, problem solving, product innovation, and creative expression.</p>\n<p>We need creative problem solvers who can navigate and operate within an increasingly complex and unpredictable world. Intermediate schools play a crucial role in helping young students realize their potential as well-rounded, well-educated, multi-talented individuals and citizens.Â By reducing the capacity of intermediate schools to do what they do best, this ill conceived cost-cutting measure undermines not only the education of our youth, but also the future of our society.</p>\n<p>Best regards,</p>\n<p>Mark</p>\n<p>Dr Mark McGuire<br />\nSenior Lecturer, Department of Applied Sciences<br />\nUniversity of Otago</p></blockquote>\n<br /> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/markmcguire.wordpress.com/2724/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/markmcguire.wordpress.com/2724/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=markmcguire.net&#038;blog=3044335&#038;post=2724&#038;subd=markmcguire&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(584,1,0,'Teleporting to Romania','text/html','http://markmcguire.net/2012/05/16/teleporting-to-romania/','Uncategorized;Blogs;Social Networking;#change11;#ds106;#cmc11;Twitter;twitter;#cck12;teleportation;photons;',NULL,NULL,31,NULL,NULL,NULL,48,'This is why I love Twitter.

Similarly, we are beginning to see new models of provision emerging in higher education. As Curtis Bonk points out in The World is Open: How Technology is Revolutionizing Education, in theory, \"[a]nyone can now learn anything from anyone at anytime\" (2009). Martin Wellers is one of an increasing numbers of academics that are promoting the benefits of open, digital scholarship (2011). However, rather than transforming how courses are designed and delivered, most institutions of higher learning are using information technology in a limited way, to enhance traditional classroom teaching (Bates, A. W. T., Sangra, A. 2011). Although institutional structures and practices may be resistant to change, innovative individuals and institutions have developed \"open\" strategies that provide models for others to follow.</p>\n<p>For several years, coordinators of OOCs (Open Online Courses) and MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) have made use of network technologies to leverage the wisdom of the crowd and to amplify the reach of tertiary courses for both credit and non-credit students (de Waard et al., 2011; Kop, Fornier, &amp; Sui Fai Mak, 2011). More recently, Stanford Engineering Everywhere (SEE) and MIT&apos;s MITx, have demonstrated how traditional, formal learning for a limited number of fee-paying students can support informal learning for a much larger number of off-campus participants for free. In this paper, I discuss recent research relating to open education and report on my experience as a non-credit participant in several open courses. I discuss recent initiatives by Stanford and MIT and reflect on the potential of Open strategies for traditional tertiary institutions.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>- Bates, A. W.

WhyÂ wouldÂ people pay in order to give their stuff away toÂ strangersÂ for free? We establish our identity and reputation online to the extent that we contribute. We can&#8217;t be heard (or seen) unless we speak. We do this by uploading, commenting, and registering our presence through our interactions with others. This has important implications for how we approach education (offline as well as online).</p>\n<p>Dan Pink&#8217;s talk reminded me of the TED talk by Sir Ken Robinson. I&#8217;ve discussed Robinson&#8217;s &#8220;Bring on the Learning Revolution&#8221; talk in <a href=\"http://markmcguire.net/2011/09/18/sir-ken-robinson-bring-on-the-learning-revolution-ted-talk-2010/\" target=\"_blank\">an earlier post</a>, and <a href=\"http://markmcguire.net/2011/09/18/tedxlondon-the-education-revolution/\" target=\"_blank\">I mentioned the TED event</a> that this talk sparked. As well as paying attention to the content of these talks, we can learn a lot from the use of <a href=\"http://markmcguire.net/2010/08/05/presentations-desi-222-lecture-monday-2-aug/\" target=\"_blank\">appropriate technologies and presentation styles</a>. Other good talks by Sir Ken Robinson include &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html\" target=\"_blank\">Schools Kill Creativity</a>&#8221; (June 2006).

Another 16 million people have seen it on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/37119711\" target=\"_blank\">Vimeo</a> over the same period.Â Apparently, the film is attracting more than justÂ attentionÂ - it has also attracted a substantial amount of money from viewers who have been moved by the story and were motivated enough to sign a pledge and make a donation (&#8220;<a href=\"https://www.stayclassy.org/checkout/donation?eid=14711\" target=\"_blank\">A minimum monthly commitment of $15</a> is required to receive the Kony 2012 Action Kit&#8221;).

So,with thanks to Diethild,Â here ia an open response to Matt&#8217;s piece.</p>\n<p>Hi Matt</p>\n<p>Thanks for your thoughtful post, &#8220;Pruning your social network connections&#8221;. Although it is now almost 1-1/2 years old, online social sites and practices continue to grow, so your points are even more relevant today.</p>\n<p>Pruning network connections seems like a very sensible thing to do. I regularly block Twitter followers who seem to have interests that are very different tan mine. For example, yesterday, I blocked <a href=\"https://twitter.com//spankjennimack\" target=\"_blank\">@SpankJenniMack</a>, who describes her herself as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I am a lifelong spanking enthusiast, spanking model, and blogger exploring the art of discipline and kink. Oh, and I&#8217;m not a brat. I&#8217;m not! I&#8217;m not!! I&#8217;m not!!!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Right. I don&#8217;t want to be followed by someone with her pants down, waving her arms wildly as she tries to pull mine down, too. Well, not in public, anyway. And I&#8217;m not interested in following her, either (she&#8217;s got 339 people chasing her already, and I don&#8217;t have the patience to wait my turn &#8211; even if I was just a tiny bit interested, which, as I&#8217;ve said, I most certainly am not).</p>\n<p>I try to make strategic use of both Twitter and my blog. My blog header says that I&#8217;m interested in education, media, and design. That&#8217;s already a pretty Catholic collection (no, I&#8217;m not particularly interested in religion &#8211; I&#8217;m a fallen Catholic, if the truth be known, and I&#8217;m not blaming @SpankJenniMack, either, or anyone even just a little bit like her, not in the least).</p>\n<p>I use Twitter to connect to people who might be interested in the things I blog about. I tag messages that might be of interest to people who are doing the same online courses, and I send direct messages to friends who I think really need to see something I&#8217;ve come across. My friends do the same for me. People who I&#8217;ve never met help me out this way, too. Its all about reciprocity &#8211; you scratch my back and I&#8217;ll scratch yours, do onto others as you would have them undo you, that kind of thing. Whoa, is it getting hot in here, or what?</p>\n<p>Where was I? Right. I like to be focussed and directional. I want to make the most efficient use of my time, and I want to mix with people like me, who think like me and who share my interests. But here&#8217;s my problem: sometimes, by complete accident, I come across someone from a very different background, with very different interests, and I see something they&#8217;ve done, or I read something they&#8217;ve written, and it just turns my brain inside out. Once I&#8217;ve settled down again, I find that I&#8217;m not quite the same person. The experience has changed me a little bit. I feel more awake and more alive. And I am grateful for the chance encounter that has shaken me up.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s true that we can&#8217;t really be friends with hundreds, or thousands, of other people. And we can&#8217;t follow more and more conversations simultaneously without feeling like we&#8217;re winding our way up the Tower of Babble. We can limit our exposure to strangers, and we can block them out when they gesture to us as we pass by. But we have to be careful that we don&#8217;t protect ourself too much. If we close ourself off completely from strangers, we risk finding ourself in a room of mirrors, where the only people we hear and see are those who reinforce our increasingly embedded beliefs and opinions. For our own good (and, sometimes, just for the fun of it), we have to leave at least one window open and one door unlocked.</p>\n<p>Mark</p>\n<br /> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/markmcguire.wordpress.com/2475/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/markmcguire.wordpress.com/2475/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=markmcguire.net&#038;blog=3044335&#038;post=2475&#038;subd=markmcguire&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(591,0,0,'Learning technology through three generations of technology enhanced distance education pedagogy','text/html','http://bnuwzj.blogspot.com/2012/09/european-journal-of-open-distance-and-e.html',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-17 09:55:33',49,'<a href=\"http://www.eurodl.org/?p=current&amp;amp;article=523#.UFdVwsJEXzg.blogger\">European Journal of Open, Distance and E-Learning</a><img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5152426418920042153-8290629346581511127?l=bnuwzj.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',1348572363,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Mon, 17 Sep 2012 16:54:00 +0000',NULL,'Openness in Education Kathy Wang',NULL,'<a href=\"http://www.eurodl.org/?p=current&amp;amp;article=523#.UFdVwsJEXzg.blogger\">European Journal of Open, Distance and E-Learning</a><img width=&apos;1&apos; height=&apos;1&apos; src=&apos;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5152426418920042153-8290629346581511127?l=bnuwzj.blogspot.com&apos; alt=&apos;&apos; />',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(592,0,0,'About this blogger','text/html','http://bnuwzj.blogspot.com/2012/09/about-this-blogger.html',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-09-17 08:56:41',49,'I am Kathy Wang, a PhD candidate from Beijing Normal University.

He points out that students who do not express themselves in class find their voice through social media. I have seen this myself using Moodle Forums. Students who say little in class, write in a forum. His point that teachers must change the way they instruct is something I am passionate about and often \"preach\". Not only should a true differentiated environment be present, but a blended one needs to exist. There should be opportunities to be online in and outside the classroom. Ultimately, I think the school day has got to change, be more flexible and meet the needs of students, not teachers. It will be hard work but I believe we will see more students succeeding. <br />How would I accomplish this? I would have classroom times for students who need structure. These times will vary course to course and year based on the students in them. One year might see 20% of student in need of structure but the next might see 50%. My school day as an instructor might be from 2 pm to&nbsp;9 pm with physical class&nbsp;time from 6-9 pm. I may be working online with students or meeting with them in small groups form 2-6 pm. My peers might be on the morning shift meeting the needs of athletes and those with afternoon jobs. <br />So do I see social media as a game changer?

I go to </FONT><A href=\"http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/researchskills/dalton.htm\"><FONT color=#000000>http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/researchskills/dalton.htm</FONT></A><FONT color=#000000>&nbsp;and take these words from the evaluation section: <br />judge<br />select<br />choose<br />decide<br />justify<br />debate<br />verify<br />argue<br />recommend<br />assess<br />discuss<br />rate<br />prioritise<br />determine<br /><br />I can now suggest these projects and student must read to participate:<br />1 - Justify the Brasov factory workers&apos; right to walk out and stage a protest. <br />2 - Debate the people&apos;s perspective versus the leader, Ceacescu&apos;s perspective on the rights of the people.<br /></FONT></SPAN><FONT color=#000000 size=3 face=Arial>3 - Recommend a different solution that Ceacescu might have used to stop the escalation of rioting in December 1989.<br /><br />The other suggestion I&apos;d like to make is to encourage students to go beyond Wikipedia. Allow them to read Wikipedia - it may help their comprehension but require different types of resources. <br />In my example you might suggest&nbsp;these resources:<br />~a person from Romania<br />~a&nbsp;book written by a Romanian<br />~YouTube Videos<br />~INFOhio Electronic Resources<br /><br />Being a 21st Century&nbsp;learner doesn&apos;t simply mean using a computer to complete assignments. Lead your students toward good practices.

Our department was the first in Canada to go exclusively laptop. This change resulted in teachers doing what they always did â€“ presenting content, now with PowerPoint instead of overhead slides. Students, in contrast, suddenly had new tools of democratic information access (and distraction) at their fingertips. While educators and education didn&apos;t really change, the learners did. </p> <p>That simple example gets at the heart of what&apos;s happening in higher education: What people do with information determines the types of institutions required in a particular era. (I wrote an article with Kathleen Matheos on this topic in 2009: <a href=\"http://ineducation.ca/article/systemic-changes-higher-education\">Systemic Changes in Higher Education</a>). Today, we see half of the education equation (the learners) doing fascinating things with content and ideas, while much of the other half (the faculty) is still taking a dissemination approach to curriculum.</p></blockquote>\nvia <a href=\"http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2012/06/16/the-future-of-higher-education-and-other-imponderables/\">The future of higher education and other imponderables</a> at elearnspace\n<p />\n<p><i>&#8230;reblogged from <a href=\"http://www.elearnspace.org/blog\">elearnspace</a>.

It seems that there are more than a few people who do not need to see that part of my life even though it is not really controversial or exciting.</p>\n<p>When I added LinkedIn, I un-friended a lot of work folks on Facebook and instead added them onto LinkedIn, which is mostly professional and locked my Facebook account down fairly tightly.Â  (At the same time, my Facebook account was expanding to include relatives and friends who were not so politically correct.)Â  My LinkedIn profile on the other hand is very open.Â  While I stay positive on both sites, their purposes and thus my identity on each is different.Â  On Facebook I can be Nana, high school social secretary, gardener, kayaker and photographer, and a little foolish.Â  On LinkedIn, I am a successful senior academic administrator with a few hobbies that wants to see what others like me are doing, so I am in lots of groups and post occasionally.Â  I would say a less participatory persona on LinkedIn than the others.Â  I pay attention to the stats that are free, but have not paid extra bucks to see additional detail.</p>\n<p>My twitter account is newer and became useful to me because of the MOOC and so I have mostly followed folks in educational technology for learning realm.Â  It has a sense of discovery for me and a way to broadcast news and links and I guess it gives me a bit of a different brand than I have on LinkedIn.Â  I am more connected to folks I really only know by reputation and brand Twitter.Â  Those who follow me are an interesting curiosity and a mix of folks from work and other things I follow.Â  I think I follow too many people to make sense of the stream sometimes; those tidbits don&#8217;t have the personal context that I have with the FB updates.</p>\n<p>Blogging is new to me but is focused thus far on education, teaching and learning and officially started with the MOOC.Â  I have allowed myself to write some half-baked ideas, which is something I have not normally put into the public sphere.</p>\n<p>Thanks Bonnie for an interesting post and sharing your work.Â  This post has helped me start to make sense of the notion of online identity and I don&#8217;t have a complicated mix of screen names or avatars.Â  I will share your post with the folks developing a new master&#8217;s degree in emerging technologies for learning and teaching at my college.Â  Cheers!</p>\n<br /> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/taiarnold.wordpress.com/71/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/taiarnold.wordpress.com/71/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=taiarnold.wordpress.com&#038;blog=33823909&#038;post=71&#038;subd=taiarnold&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(615,0,0,'De-Googling','text/html','http://taiarnold.wordpress.com/2012/04/04/de-googling/','Uncategorized;',NULL,NULL,36,NULL,NULL,NULL,55,'I have begun the process of removing Google from my life.

Â  This allows us to define the <em>what â€“</em> without being overly prescriptive and still value the diversity of approaches to learning andÂ  goals of students.Â  It also allows us to support open education by not closing down the curriculum as the outcomes that are defined will indeed define the curriculum.</p>\n<p>They go a bit further in saying that we ought to establish as learning outcomes even those things that are difficult to measure.Â  &#8220;It follows that the greater the students&apos; involvement in and with the learning, the greater the possibility of different learning outcomes emerging. &#8230;we propose that those who teach should begin to reclaim learning outcomes and begin to frame them more broadly and flexibly, to allow for demonstrations and expressions of appreciation, enjoyment and even pleasure, in the full knowledge that such outcomes pose problems for assessment.&#8221;Â I like it, but as the adage goes, you don;t change what you don&#8217;t measure, so we need ideas about how to measure these sorts of things.Â  And yes, I would be looking for valid reliable assessments that are not easy to pull apart.</p>\n<p>I certainly have more questions than answers at this point.Â  If emergent learning is valued and something that we cannot really predict, then what should the we say is the goal for our learners?Â  Is it something to do with discovery and creativity in designing their learning?Â Â  Is about continuous reflection and retrospective analysis of learning both within and outside of the course? What captures this notion so that the goal is blatantly stated and our students know that we value their discoveries and diversions?

I feel a little inadequate critiquing because I&apos;m not sure I can offer something more useful, but I&apos;ll try.&nbsp; </p>\n<p>The elements of the <a href=\"http://davecormier.com/edblog/2011/11/05/rhizomatic-learning-why-learn/\">rhizome metaphor</a> Dave Cormier presents that are most useful for me are that learning can take its own path, as well as mutuality, egalitarianism and resilience. The validation of multiple paths with each to its own ends is heartening.  I agree that it is necessary to have connection and interaction with others and their ideas. The mutuality or symbiosis shared by different organisms make to one another other successful, each contributing its share to the other. It is further enhanced when the node is not privileged. If I only think about the horizontal and somewhat unpredictable nature of adding a new node that has the same capacities as the first node, then I see egalitarianism and perhaps a nonhierarchical system and certainly resilience. The capacity to regenerate a network or grow new connections even if disconnected from the origin provides hope.  </p>\n<p>When I think about the how rhizomes work in nature, the resilience is not in the system, but in individual capacity.&nbsp; The individual has everything needed to carry on.  The rhizome is a singular organism and propagates itself by branching and creating new centers, each growing away from itself.  The value is that once mature, each center is equal, and apart from environmental influences, identical to the center that sent out the horizontal growth. Its serves the ultimate purpose: reproduction.  </p>\n<p>The ever-outward branching does not account for unsystematic connections between and among nodes of different types and does not readily adapt to change or learn.  With the rhizome, evolution is glacial â€“&nbsp; and the common conceptualization of evolution is a branching hierarchical tree. I am looking for something more encompassing and interconnected rather than ever-branching, and for something that is anything but homogeneous and self-replicating.</p>\n<p>The network model provides the capacity to connect or add something new and reshape the nodes and the storage capacity.&nbsp; It&#8217;s shape and growth are not fixed, though there may be hierarchy, or not.&nbsp; The changes that occur because of learning are not necessarily hierarchical. I am thinking of a network that has the capacity to change and include new elements from outside.&nbsp; However, I have difficulty with the idea that machines store more than information or serve as more than sophisticated calculators, sorting devices, bridges and conduits. Even in Harry Potter, the magical stored memories were of no use until Harry experienced them and made them his.&nbsp; The use of the words &#8220;learning,&#8221; &#8220;knowing&#8221; and &#8220;remembering&#8221; to me signify some sort of embodiment and sentience that I cannot cede to a machine, device or even a magician&#8217;s vial.&nbsp;  </p>\n<p>In short, I like the organic nature of the rhizome and the sense of mutuality, but seek more than symbiosis, where the both the individual and the collective adapt to and create new things. Diversity makes it interesting and rich.&nbsp; I keep heading toward the idea of a learning ecology.&nbsp; It can adapt, change and even be&nbsp;disrupted and something new emerge and it allows for sustainable gardening. <img src=&apos;http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif&apos; alt=&apos;:)&apos; class=&apos;wp-smiley&apos; /> <i> The syllabus becomes a garden space, a context setting within which learning can happen and the curriculum is the things that grows there.</i></p>\n<p>The real value in the metaphor is that it provides a way for people to think about abstract concepts and try to examine their own assumptions and preconceptions.

Abundant content is insufficient in creating the conditions for learning, but it does significantly change the ecology for learning.</p>\n<p>The notion that people design and engage in their own self-directed learning was well documented by <a href=\"http://allentough.com/\">Allen Tough</a> in 1971 in his book <i>Adult&#8217;s Learning Projects: A Fresh Approach to Theory and Practice in Adult Learning.</i> (The full text is available on his web site, but the url does not appear in the address bar so I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to link to it.) The extra-collegiate learning he describes has long been the focus of prior learning assessment for credit towards a degree.</p>\n<p>The term <i>prior </i>is a set up for severing connections.&nbsp; It assumes that extra-collegiate learning occurs prior to and apart from engagement in college. It discounts the connections that learners make to and from formal to informal learning projects, and the self-directed learning that may arises from the confluence of prescriptive learning such as a formal college class and emergent learning that might satisfy a curiosity..</p>\n<p>So what about the learning that happens in the spaces in between formal education? in a <a href=\"http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/883/1686\">recent article</a> Karousou and Mackness (2011) describe emergent learning and provide a wonderful example for the higher education context. Their description parallels how those in the field of prior learning assessment describe the learning being assessed through prior learning assessment methods. Since prior learning that is considered for college credit is often not the result of a prescriptive learning plan, the student writes a retrospective reflection and analysis of that learning, making sense of it.<br />\n<blockquote>&#8220;Since emergent learning is unpredictable but retrospectively coherent, we cannot determine in advance what will happen, but we can make sense of it after the event. It&apos;s not disordered; the order is just not predictable. We can summarize this as follows: Emergent learning is likely to occur when many self-organising agents interact frequently and openly, with considerable degrees of freedom, but within specific constraints; no individual can see the whole picture; agents and system co-evolve.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Karousou and Mackness go on to say that &#8220;Validation and self-correction within emergent learning networks remains an issue. Many academics still dismiss emergent learning and Web 2.0 as peripheral or even irrelevant to \"real\" formal learning because they see no mechanisms for validation and self-correction.&#8221; There are ways to validate and accredit learning that does not occur as a direct result of of formal instruction or even fit the prescribed curriculum. It is incumbent on academe to recognize redefine the recognition and and assessment of prior learning as the recognition and assessment of emergent learning. Trying to come up with a way to use REAL as the acronym that would at least work in English. </p>\n<p>I think the example in the article is worth reposting as it make clear the kind of learning that ought be recognized. <br />\n<blockquote>&#8220;In research conducted for the UK Higher Education Academy&apos;s Learning Observatory programme, learning narratives were gathered to explore how students actually went about their learning (Williams, Karousou, &amp; Gumtau, 2008). One of these narratives, the Learning Journey, illustrates the way in which emergent learning may arise serendipitously, as it were, in the learning of someone enrolled for a prescriptive learning programme. </p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><blockquote></blockquote>\n<p>This narrative concerns the learning that takes place when April, a mature part-time student in an Early Years Childhood Education degree, goes on a visit to a preschool centre of excellence and a related preschool. April is a preschool manager. On her visit to the centre, she notices:<br />\n<blockquote>There were certain things that stuck in my mind about their environment that was completely different to my own. For instance, they have glass bottles, glass vases with flowers on the tables. And really, the fact that the children were so well behaved and quiet, made a big impression, thinking: how can I influence my children to be quieter?</p></blockquote>\n<p>April engages with several staff members at the school and the centre and becomes a member of an informal community of practice (CoP). From her interaction within this CoP, she gains enough confidence to embark on a complete change management programme at her own preschool (despite the skepticism of her fellow teachers), incorporating ideas from her visit and from further interaction in this CoP. </p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>April was only required to write up a report on her visit and some lessons learnt. However, her learning journey goes way beyond the requirements of her prescriptive learning programme, particularly at a first-year level, in what might be called emergent learning. April engages in an unpredicted and far more complex task than was prescribed by her course. This learning was retrospectively coherent and influenced by her participation in an implicit and emergent community of practice. Although this community was small and several participants could probably \"see the whole picture,\" April&apos;s learning within it was not formally managed. April&apos;s case is one of entirely self-organised, small-scale emergent learning with little or no integration into formal, prescriptive learning or the curriculum.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>This example shows emergent learning that is more sophisticated and advanced than the original intended outcomes of the formal course.&nbsp; If I go back to <a href=\"http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2011/09/15/duplication-theory-of-educational-value/\">Siemens </a>and put the assessment of such learning alongside other services that cannot be duplicated including guidance from another human being that can help the learner place such an experience into their formal studies, then there is a possibility of reducing the cost of higher education and time to degree completion by including emergent learning or informal learning as Tough called into the credentialed learning. </p>\n<p><b>References</b><br />Droegkamp, J. and Taylor, K.

I see the promise in open learning as reducing significant financial and location barriers and allowing broad access to learning resources, but how such learning could be assessed and credentialed is still fuzzy.  </p>\n<p>This credentialing will need to be coupled with other services. <a href=\"http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2011/09/15/duplication-theory-of-educational-value/\">Siemens recently opined</a>, \"What is valuable, however, is that which can&apos;t be duplicated without additional input costs: personal feedback and assessment, contextualized and personalized navigation through complex topics, encouragement, questioning by a faculty member to promote deeper thinking, and a context and infrastructure of learning.\" While Siemens&#8217; defines broader services and I still want to track on that idea, for the moment I am just thinking about what is needed to assess learning so that it can count toward a degree. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cew.georgetown.edu/collegepayoff/\">Carnevale reports</a> that degrees are still important currency in gaining employment and in earnings. Because learners still need credentials, a badge to show for what they know and can do, I want to focus a bit on credentials and assessment of learning. I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll be back around to the mentoring, which I agree is essential. For the moment I want to think about the role of higher education institutions will have a greater role in recognition of learning from its many sources. Learning is acquired outside of formal higher education; it is often equivalent to college learning but doesn&apos;t carry credit. Colleges and institutions are the institutions that can assess validate and credential that learning. As Susan Huggins puts it \"People learn outside the traditional classroom â€“ and it should be valued.\" </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://cael.org/\">Council on Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL)</a> led the work in the US to create processes to assess learning gained outside of formal higher education and provides a broadly accepted definition of prior learning assessment: <br />\n<blockquote><i>Prior learning is a term used by educators to describe learning that a person acquires outside a traditional academic environment. This learning may have been acquired through work experience, employer training programs, independent study, non-credit courses, volunteer or community service, travel, or non-college courses or seminars.</p>\n<p>Prior learning assessment (PLA) is a term used to describe the process by which an individual&apos;s experiential learning is assessed and evaluated for purposes of granting college credit, certification, or advanced standing toward further education or training. There are four generally accepted approaches to PLA and, when properly conducted, all ensure academic quality: (1) national standardized exams in specified disciplines, e.g., Advanced Placement (AP) exams, College Level Examination Program (CLEP) tests, Excelsior college exams, Dantes Subject Standardized Texts (DSST); (2) challenge exams for local courses; (3) evaluated noncollege programs, e.g., American Council on Education (ACE) evaluations of corporate training and military training; and (4) individualized assessments, particularly portfolio-based assessments.</i><br /><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/news?viewArticle=&amp;articleID=772286418&amp;gid=1295137&amp;type=member&amp;item=70712808&amp;articleURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ecael%2Eorg%2Fpdfs%2FPLA_research_brief_avg_credit&amp;urlhash=-s9P&amp;trk=group_most_recent_rich-0-b-shrttl\">Moving the Starting Line Through Prior Learning Assessment (PLA); CAEL August 2011</a> </p></blockquote>\n<p>National standardized tests already reach broad audiences and are accepted by institutions across the US.&nbsp; Some institution offer their own course challenge exams.&nbsp; Although exams are efficient and readily scalable, they can&#8217;t be used for many emergent fields or for learning that does not fit the predefined boundaries of a specific topic or course. Evaluations of non-collegiate sponsored programs are also reasonably efficient ways to assess learning, but require the sponsoring entity to pay for the evaluation and for updates.&nbsp; They require some individual work in matching documentation to recommended credit awards, but the evaluations are reliable and cataloged, so efficiencies are possible.</p>\n<p>Much of what people learn falls in between and around what is currently assessed through standardized exams what evaluations of non-formal education programs.&nbsp; Additionally, learners may have non-formal education coupled with finely honed expertise acquired through experience that provides yet another level of learning that should be recognized.&nbsp; However, only a handful of institutions conduct prior learning assessment on a large scale and, even then, that credit is generally good only at the institution at which it was earned, perhaps born of distrust of PLA or institutional protectionism. Thomas Edison State College, Excelsior College and Charter Oak State College have long provided credit banking services, but need broader access is required. </p>\n<p>The Council on Adult and Experiential Learning&apos; <a href=\"http://www.learningcounts.org/\">Learning Counts</a> and <a href=\"http://knext.com/\">KNEXT</a> are two new efforts intended to ramp up scalable individualized PLA program that could address the need for individualized assessment. These services manage the individualized assessment and evaluation processes and provide trustworthy credit recommendations. ACE will serve as the \"registrar\" for CAEL recommendations and KNEXT is managing their own documentation. Both organizations are working on portability of these credit recommendations, forging agreements with higher education institutions.

In this post, we answer six key questions that get at the underlying assumptions we have about the problem we are trying to solve.</p>\n<p>1. What causes the problem?</p>\nThere are several causes to the problem we are trying to solve. First, teachers generally lack training and expertise in the assessment theory and practice. Teachers do not usually receive this training because assessment and measurement are often not the highest priorities for teacher preparation programs that focus more on pedagogy, curriculum development, and classroom management. Simply put, there just isn&#8217;t enough curricular room in pre-service training programs for courses that cover assessment and measurement in any useful depth or breadth. Teachers in higher education, on the other hand, rarely receive even a basic training in the teaching profession &#8211; let alone training in assessment. Second, assessment development is time-consuming. Teachers who desire the highest quality assessments for their students will attempt to write tests themselves in order to align their assessments as much as possible with the curriculum in their classroom. The time spent writing assessments can be an incredible time sink. What&#8217;s more, without measurement expertise, these tests are often of suspect quality in terms of validity and reliability. Third, assessment adoption is either very expensive or results in tests that are of unknown quality. Perhaps most often, teachers will adopt test items from other sources &#8211; like textbooks and test banks. Test banks containing high quality items are expensive (ETS spends upwards of $200 per item to develop their highest quality assessments &#8211; like the SAT and GRE &#8211; for example). In reality, most test banks are written by people with very little measurement expertise, and they are always written to broad, general standards (if at all). Rarely are items aligned specifically to any one set of state (let alone district or school or teacher) standards. As an example, one of our colleagues recalls with fondness his days as a graduate student when his advisor would pay his students $1 per item to help compile a test bank for a new textbook he had written. One can only guess how much attention was given to each item by those starving graduate students.\n<p>2. Think about the people with the problem. What are they currently doing, or willing to do, to solve it?</p>\n<p>Teachers with this problem are generally not doing much to solve it, even if they want to. For starters, there are very few options for in-service or pre-service teachers to obtain training in measurement and assessment. Thus, we suspect that most teachers do not see this is a practically solvable problem or simply view low-quality test banks as one kind of solution. Despite this, some forward-thinking teachers have begun collaborating with colleagues within their school, district or institution on assessment development or item adoption initiatives.</p>\n<p>3. What are all of the current solutions to the problem?</p>\n<p>Current solutions to the problem of low assessment expertise among teachersÂ are generally quite expensive. There are some assessment training workshops that teachers (or schools) can pay to attend, but these have deep costs in terms of fees, travel, and time. Â We don&#8217;t know of any current solutions to the problem of inaccessibility to higher quality test items. The higher the quality, the more expensive the item. In all cases we know of, these costs are always passed onto to the item user.</p>\n<p>4. Why aren&apos;t the current solutions good enough?</p>\n<p>The expense of the current solutions is prohibitive, especially in the current economic climate. In fact, as the demand for high quality classroom assessment goes up, the money that is needed to improve assessment quality is going down.</p>\n<p>5. How long has it been a problem?</p>\n<p>Classroom teachers have always lacked training in assessment and measurement. However, the demand for high quality assessment is much more recent. Ever since the first education reform policies hit the ground in the 1960s (in the U.S. at least), the focus on measurable progress and assessment has increased with each subsequent policy revision. In addition, access to high quality test items has been prohibitively expensive for as long as such items have been available.</p>\n<p>6. How easily could something change to make the problem go away?</p>\n<p>This problem could be fairly easily solved with the use of open educational resources, a little bit of money, and current technologies &#8211; especially the collaborative potential of the Internet. You can read more about our proposed solution to this problem on a previous <a href=\"http://tjbliss.org/openassessment-org-our-edstartup-idea/\" target=\"_blank\">post.</a></p>\n<p>With our general assumptions now explicated, our next step in the pain test is to conduct a little market research. Talking directly with teachers (and faculty in education programs) will help us verify these assumptions and make revisions to our ideas. Most importantly, this field test will help us know if the pain we&#8217;re trying to alleviate is as real and sharp as we assume.</p>\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(623,0,0,'OpenAssessment.org &#8211; Our EdStartup Idea','text/html','http://tjbliss.org/openassessment-org-our-edstartup-idea/','Ed Tech Startup;Open Education;assessment;edstartup;idea;OER;',NULL,NULL,37,NULL,NULL,NULL,56,'The Idea We* want to create a collaboratively developed database of openly licensed assessment items and measurement training.

The openly licensed measurement training will also be freely available to all users.</p>\n<p><strong>The Problem<br />\n</strong>Teachers lack the time, resources, and expertise needed to create high quality classroom assessments. And even in the rare cases where time, resources, and expertise are not limited, typical classroom assessments still lack the number of responses necessary for the kinds of measurement analyses that could help teachers improve their classroom assessments in a systematic way.</p>\n<p><strong>The Solution<br />\n</strong>A collaboratively developed database of openly licensed assessment items will allow teachers to improve the quality of their classroom assessments by (a) providing them with increased access to higher quality test items, and (b) providing them with access to measurement training and support. All users will have free basic access to all items in the database because the items will be openly licensed. In addition, the collaborative approach to item development will decrease the individual time needed to create high quality assessments by capitalizing on the inputs of a community of subject-matter experts. Also, item writing training and psychometric support will increase teachers&apos; practical measurement skills. Finally, items used within the internal delivery and analytics system will have large enough response numbers to allow for more sophisticated psychometric analyses and item improvement.</p>\n<p><strong>The Why</strong><br />\nHigh quality assessment of student learning is important for making sound pedagogical and administrative decisions. However, many important educational decisions are based on assessment results that aren&apos;t highly valid or reliable. This is especially true at the classroom level. But this is not because many teachers don&apos;t want to improve their assessments. Most teachers couldn&apos;t do much about this problem even if they wanted to. They not only lack the funds and training, but they simply don&apos;t have enough item responses to conduct many psychometric analyses. Indeed, many teachers lack the time, software, training, and secure server space to even maintain a database of items and their psychometric properties. By providing teachers with increased access to this kind of database and to practical measurement training we can improve the quality of assessment in our educational institutions.</p>\n<p>*Current intellectual contributors to this idea include myself, David Wiley, T.

New OER policies should be clearly tied to older, related policies. &#8220;The more a new issue can be made to look like an old issue, the more likely it is to be placed on an agenda&#8221; (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/American-Public-Policy-Promise-Performance/dp/1568029063\" target=\"_blank\">Peters, 1986, p. 47</a>).</p>\n<p>6. Advocates of OER policy should understand and use the power of the media (new and old) to shape policy. &#8220;Media influence on the process and content of policies varies according to type of issue, stage of process, time frame, and political and media systems. Under certain circumstances, the media can be a crucial player. It depends on what is covered, how often, and how it is framed&#8221; (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Politics-News/dp/1568024126\" target=\"_blank\">Paletz, 1998, p. 234</a>).</p>\n<p>7. The language of policy can be as important as the policy itself. &#8220;Social&#8221; rhetoric and symbolism should be used in advocating for OER policies. &#8220;To heighten participation, issues may be connected to sweeping social themes, such as justice, democracy, and liberty&#8221; (<a href=\"http://cstpr.colorado.edu/students/envs_5000/rochefort_cobb1994.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Rochefort &amp; Cobb, 1994, p. 5</a>). And, &#8220;the more closely a particular problem can be linked to certain important national [or international] symbols, the greater its probability of being placed on the agenda&#8221; (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/American-Public-Policy-Promise-Performance/dp/1568029063\" target=\"_blank\">Peters, 1986, p. 48</a>).</p>\n<p>8. OER policy reform should be influenced, if not led, by people with expertise in education. &#8220;What is significant about much of the interest group activity [in educational policymaking], and what distinguishes it from previousÂ activism, is the prominence of non-educators leading the reform efforts&#8221; (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Better-Policies-Schools-Theories-Applications/dp/0205321526\" target=\"_blank\">Cooper et al. 2004, p. 76</a>).</p>\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(625,0,0,'Open Education and Democracy','text/html','http://tjbliss.org/open-education-and-democracy/','Uncategorized;learning theory;OER;open education;',NULL,NULL,37,NULL,NULL,NULL,56,'If you were to walk up to some random person waiting for the bus and say, &#8220;Hey, did you know that learning is &#8216;the act of gaining knowledge?&#8217;&#8221;, you probably wouldn&#8217;t end up in a heated theoretical street fight (though &#8230; <a href=\"http://tjbliss.org/open-education-and-democracy/\">Continue reading &#8594;</a>',1348573206,NULL,NULL,'tjbliss','http://tjbliss.org','Thu, 06 Sep 2012 19:29:57 +0000',NULL,'aperta educationem &#187; Blog',NULL,'<p>If you were to walk up to some random person waiting for the bus and say, &#8220;Hey, did you know that learning is &#8216;<a href=\"http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/learning\">the act of gaining knowledge</a>?&#8217;&#8221;, you probably wouldn&#8217;t end up in a heated theoretical street fight (though I&#8217;d like to witness one of those some day). Indeed, Collins&#8217; definition of learning seems fairly straightforward andÂ innocuous. What we need to recognize, though, is that underlying this definition of learning is the metaphor of acquisition.</p>\n<p>Within the metaphor of acquisition the goal of learning is individual enrichment; learning is the acquisition of something; the student is the recipient or consumer; the teacher is the provider or mediator; knowledge is a property, possession, or commodity; and knowing is equivalent to having or possessing knowledge (see the left side of <a href=\"http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phys4810/phys4810_fa08/4810_readings/Sfard.pdf\">Table 1</a> created by Anna Sfard).</p>\n<p>You probably aren&#8217;t surprised by the acquisition metaphor for learning. Odds are, you agree with all or part of it. In fact, the vast majority of people view learning through this metaphor, and have done so forÂ millennia. But despite (or perhaps because of) its near universal acceptance and elegant conceptual framework, the acquisition metaphor for learning has had at least one important effect on society: the commodification of knowledge. <a href=\"http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phys4810/phys4810_fa08/4810_readings/Sfard.pdf\">Anna Sfard</a> described the consequences of knowledge commodification in a vivid and accessible way:</p>\n<p>&#8220;If knowledge is conceived of as a commodity, it is only natural that attitudes toward learning reflect the way the given society thinks about material wealth. When figuratively equated, knowledge and material possessions are likely to play similar roles in establishing people&#8217;s identities and in defining their social positions. In the class-ridden capitalist society, for example, knowledge understood as property is likely to turn into an additional attribute of position and power. Like material goods, knowledge has the permanent quality that makes the privileged position of its owner equally permanent. As result, learning according to the acquisition metaphor may draw people apart rather than bring them together&#8230;A not-altogether-infrequent occurrence of self-centered, asocial attitude toward knowing, creating, and learning is certainly a case in point. If people are valued and segregated according to what they have, the metaphor of intellectual property is more likely to feed rivalry than collaboration.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Another way to view learning is through the metaphor of participation. Within this metaphor the goal of learning is community building; learning is defined as becoming a participant; students are peripheral participants or apprentices; teachers are expert participants and perservers of practice; knowledge is an aspect of practice, discourse, or activity; and knowing is defined as belonging, participating, or communicating (the right side of Sfard&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phys4810/phys4810_fa08/4810_readings/Sfard.pdf\">Table 1</a>).</p>\n<p>Almost prophetically, Sfard argued that &#8220;the participation metaphor has a potential to lead to a new, more democratic practice of learning and teaching&#8230;Only time will tell whether the promise of a more democratic process of learning, brought by [the participation metaphor], is going to materialize.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that Sfard published her prediction in 1998, just as the concepts for open education were being formulated. In the ensuing 14 years, the open education movement has exploded. Knowledge is becoming uncommoditized at an unprecedented rate and people the world over are realizing that &#8220;education for all&#8221; is a near-term reality, not just a fool&#8217;s dream (or worse). The Internet and the legal &#8220;freedoms&#8221; of Open Educational Resources have made participatory collaborative content development possible and increasingly popular.</p>\n<p>Is open education a materialization of Sfard&#8217;s prediction?Â If so, it seems time that we started exploring to what extent the open education movement is contributing to a &#8220;more democratic practice of learning and teaching&#8221; around the world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(626,0,0,'The EdTech Startup Space','text/html','http://tjbliss.org/the-edtech-startup-space/','Ed Tech Startup;edstartup;space;',NULL,NULL,37,NULL,NULL,NULL,56,'The introductory material on EdStartup 101Â really provided me with my first foray into the fast-paced and exciting world of educational technology startups.

They argued that whileÂ eclecticismÂ seems to offer practical advantages by allowing researchers and designers to freely pick and choose among manifest features of various theories (choosing only that which seems practical), it &#8220;ignores or discourages critical reflection regarding implicit assumptions and values&#8221; of those theories. Â The authors argued that all educational designers use &#8220;conceptual design sense&#8221; which &#8220;entails an [educational] designer&#8217;s assumptions and values &#8211; often unarticulated and unexamined &#8211; about the diverse aspects of the enterprise of instructional design.&#8221; Their point was that everyone engaged in designing instruction or content is operating under certain guiding principles and ideas about concepts like knowledge, mind, agency, learning, technology, and assessment. Those (it appears rare) individuals who operate within a traditional orthodoxy generally subscribe wholesale to the assumptions and values of thisÂ orthodoxy. But the much more common eclectic usually operates within &#8220;a kind of hidden framework&#8221; informed by various traditional theories, assumptions and values. And these theories, assumptions and values &#8220;to some significant degree guide important aspects of the [educational] design process.&#8221;Â Yanchar and Gabittas call this hidden framework a &#8220;cryptotheory.&#8221; As evidence of the existence of cryptotheories,Â <a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/911j85m78760k843/\">Yanchar et al. (2010)</a> found that &#8220;designers reported using theoretical principles eclectically in their work, but were often vague on which ones they uses (or their names), how they used them, and what guided their choices and applications.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To manage these issues of design sense inÂ eclecticism, Yanchar and Gabittas (2011) proposed an alternative approach to educational design, called <em>critical flexibility</em>. &#8220;Critical flexibility,&#8221; they argued &#8220;calls for a critical stance towards one&#8217;s own design sense and an awareness of alternative views that may facilitate the gradual development of one&#8217;s practice.&#8221; In a word, they offered a means of becoming aware of one&#8217;s own cryptotheory.</p>\n<p>So what does all of this have to do with open education? It seems to me (though I haven&#8217;t done a specific study on this&#8230;yet) that the people involved in designing MOOCs, open courseware, open digital courses, and other open educational resources would be inclined to anÂ eclecticÂ approach &#8211; an approach to educational design that draws on many theories and uses those that seem most practical. Open education is all about practicality. However, Yanchar and Gabittas have got me thinking. How much better could these OER be if their designers were more critically aware of the cryptotheories guiding their work? In the same way, how much better would research on the effect of open educational initiatives be if the researchers and the funders were more self aware of the cryptotheories under which they operate? I&#8217;ve run into this personally where it was learned after the fact (meaning: after the check had been cut) that the funder and the researcher were operating under very different assumptions about educational outcomes and even about what constitutes learning.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s your cryptotheory?</p>\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(628,0,0,'Why I Advocate For Open Education','text/html','http://tjbliss.org/why-i-advocate-opened/','Open Education;advocacy;cost of education;OER;opened;',NULL,NULL,37,NULL,NULL,NULL,56,'I asked my extremely intelligent wife to read my previous post before I published it to the world.

She said she thought it was well-written (thanks, hun), but also said it sounded like a simple regurgitation of a bunch of things I&#8217;ve learned about open education and OER. She explained that based on the title, she was sort of expecting something along the lines of an opinion piece that explains why I think open education is important and why I spend so much time doing what I do. My wife was spot on. I did not intend to opine about the virtues of openness in that post. Instead, my intention was to provide a cogent technical argument for why and how open education, and OER specifically, can increase access to education. But the editorial conversation with my sweetheart got me thinking, and in between my pushing the publish button and her giving birth to our fourth child (good job, dear, you were awesome!), I decided to face the critical questions head-on: WhyÂ <em>do</em> I think open education is important and what drives me to study OER?</p>\n<p>The short answer to both of these questions can be found in a single quote from an at-risk community college student: &#8220;I have no expendable income. Without this free OERÂ textbook, I would not be able to take this course.&#8221; This student was considered &#8220;at-risk&#8221; of dropping out of college for primarily economic reasons.</p>\n<p>Of course, there is a longer answer to why I advocate for open education.</p>\n<p>First of all, I realize that education costs money.Â Teachers, in order to devote their lives to teaching, have to make a living. Research that generates new knowledge cannot be conducted in a vacuum (well, some types of chemical and astrophysical research require a vacuum, but that&#8217;s beyond the point). Technologies to assist in the contextualization and sense-making of new knowledge are not cheap to develop or to implement. The very important, but often overlooked, curators of knowledge (like librarians) cannot be expected to do their critical work pro bono. Valid assessments that show that sense has been made do not write themselves (trust me on this one; sometimes I moonlight as a psychometrician.)</p>\n<p>In fact, I don&#8217;t know of many people who are trying to make an argument for completely free education. Sure, there are excellent <a href=\"http://wikipedia.org\" target=\"_blank\">opportunities</a> now for individuals to gain access to content (and even <a href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">pedagogical sense-making</a>) at little cost to them personally. But, as argued above, the generation, distribution, and meaning-making of content all cost money at some time and in some way.</p>\n<p>The real advantage of open education and OER, especially, is that they allow for a redistribution of the costs of education toward better ways to improve student success. For instance, money saved on textbooks through the adoption of open educational resources (like the nearly $25 million in estimated savings in Utah this year) could be used to hire more (and better) teachers, make the teaching profession more competitive, or promote the reality that teachers are, in fact, professionals (as well as help teachers improve their profession through advanced PD). As an aside, some may argue that perception of teacher professionalism is not an important educational factor. A recent <a href=\"www.oecd.org/pisa/46623978.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report from OECD</a>, however, would counter this by arguing that all of the top performing countries on the PISA have high public regard for teachers as professionals. The United States, on the other hand, does not (just ask any teacher you might know).</p>\n<p>These are just a few examples of how OER could positively impact education. Other possibilities include redistribution of funds toward more educational research, improving teacher education programs, developing and implementing new educational technologies, and so forth. I haven&#8217;t included any direct student benefits of OER here, but they are very important as well and will certainly be discussed in future posts.</p>\n<p>The main point is this: Education is not free. Those who want a credential should probably always be expected to pay something for it. But why should they continue to spend money on components of the educational enterprise that no longer cost much at all, like the copying and distribution of educational content?Â The at-risk community college student I quoted above was willing to invest in a formal, credentialed education. However, the significant &#8211; and now mostly unnecessary &#8211; costs of educational content threatened to become a barrier to her success.</p>\n<p>Another point is this: Some education can be (essentially) free. Individuals who are not interested in, or cannot afford the base price, for a credential, now have access to massive amounts of educational content. These people can access the inherent benefits of knowledge without working toward a formal degree. And millions are doing so on a daily basis, thanks to generous and forward-thinking people who realize that they don&#8217;t need to keep the content (or even the sense-making) secure, just the credentialing process. <a href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu\" target=\"_blank\">MIT&#8217;s OpenCourseWare</a> is a model example of this type of openness in education. And there are many <a href=\"http://www.ocwconsortium.org/en/courses/ocwsites\" target=\"_blank\">others.</a></p>\n<p>So there you have it. I advocate for open education because I see how it can break down potential barriers to student success and create opportunities for learning at every level of society in nearly every society on the planet.</p>\n<p>I would love to know why you advocate for open education as well. Or, if you see holes in my argument, please engage and tell me where I&#8217;ve missed the boat&#8230;or even the train.</p>\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(629,0,0,'EdStartup 101 Introductory Post','text/html','http://tjbliss.org/edstartup-101-introductory-post/','Ed Tech Startup;edstartup;intro;syndicated;',NULL,NULL,37,NULL,NULL,NULL,56,'Edstartup 101Â has begun and the squishy &#8220;ice-breaker&#8221; ball has been thrown to me!

Most of the things teachers share with students are somewhat magical in that they can <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/opencontent/why-be-open\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;be given without being given away.&#8221;</a>Â When a teacher imparts her knowledge to a student, the teacher does not lose possession of her knowledge. In fact, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching#Learning_by_teaching_by_Martin_.28LdL.29\" target=\"_blank\">some</a> would argue that knowledge can even be deepened through the very act of sharing it with others. Yet, some things teachers share with students, like textbooks, must be physically given away. If I have a textbook and then I give it to you, I lose possession of the book and you assume it.</p>\n<p>In recent educational history, textbooks have become the central modicum of the knowledge sharing process. As valuable as these resources can be to students (and to teachers), the <a href=\"http://www.lib.umich.edu/files/SPOTextbookBackground.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">rising costs in textbooks</a> have begun to seriously impact the overall cost of education at all levels. Researchers and others are just now exploring the true impact of these costs, especially in terms of how they <a href=\"http://uso.flatworldpartnerships.com/\">affect studentÂ persistence and completion rates in college</a> and how<a href=\"http://openedgroup.org/publications\"> they affect K-12 school budgets</a>.</p>\n<p>With the advent of the digital age, a breakthrough in the knowledge sharing process has occurred. For the first time in human history, knowledgeÂ <em>and</em> the physical expressions of knowledge (textbooks and other educational resources) can both be &#8220;given without being given away.&#8221; For example, the Internet allows for all of the content in a newspaper to be distributed to millions of subscribers without a single physical transfer of paper. In the physical world, the cost of copy and delivery per object is quite high. For example, the cost to copy one 250-page book by hand is roughly $1,000. The cost to copy the same book by print-on-demand services is about $4.50. But the cost to copy the book digitally is only $0.00084! And this isn&#8217;t all. The cost to distribute the same 250-page book by mail is about $5.20. The cost to distribute it online: $0.00072.</p>\n<p>There is more to the educational sharing process than just copying and distributing knowledge, however. Once in possession of physical expressions of knowledge, the real craft of teaching is in sense-making and meaning-making. Teachers do this by reconnecting new knowledge with prior knowledge and/or relating it to past experience. In a word, teachers are master editors of content. Because of the high cost of editing physical expressions of knowledge like textbooks, teachers accomplish their sense-making through verbal communication or digital summaries. But in this brave new world of digital content, editing physical expressions of knowledge has also become essentially free.</p>\n<p>With the removal of the economic constraints on copying, distributing, and editing content, we are able to share (and educate) like never before. Except we can&#8217;t, because copyright laws prohibit and otherwise restrict the copying, distributing, and editing of content. In essence, what the Internet enables, copyright forbids.</p>\n<p>To solve this problem and truly open up education in the digital world, some very innovative <a href=\"http://davidgagnon.wordpress.com/2008/09/24/10-years-of-open-education/\">movers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/larry_lessig_says_the_law_is_strangling_creativity.html\">shakers</a>Â envisioned a way to use existing copyright law toÂ enforceÂ sharing. Inspired by the open source movement in software development, in 1999 David Wiley and others started thinking of educators as publishers and created the first open publication license &#8211; a copyright license designed to legally certify that a particular piece of digital (or even analog) content could be reused, redistributed, remixed, or revised. David et al. were not, however, legal experts, and the validity of their license was questionable. Thankfully, a few years after the initial inception of open educational licenses, Larry Lessig (a certified legal genius) and <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org\">Creative Commons</a> developed a legally valid way to &#8220;minimize legal, technical, and social barriers to [the] sharing and reuse ofÂ <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/education\">educational materials</a>.&#8221; Creative CommonsÂ <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/\">licenses</a>Â allow individuals and institutions to develop educational materials that can be legally copied, distributed, and edited.</p>\n<p>The <em>open</em> in &#8220;open education&#8221; and &#8220;open educational resources&#8221; is the free permission to reuse, redistribute, remix, and revise educational materials (now commonly called &#8220;the 4 Rs&#8221;). Openness is the means whereby we can overcome the restrictions of copyright law and use digital content to its full educative potential.Â What the Internet enables, OER now allows. And what the Internet enables and OER allows is sharing and educating at an unprecedented scale.</p>\n<p>This post presents an introduction and a technical argument for open education. It can also be found on a permanent page <a href=\"http://tjbliss.org/why-open-education\">here</a>. Future posts will address the political, financial, serendipity, quality, innovation, and moral arguments of openness in education.</p>\n<p>Note: Many of the ideas, as well as the framework, for this post came from a singleÂ <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/opencontent/why-be-open\">presentation</a> and myriad personal conversations with David Wiley.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(631,37,0,'Open education or dumping content #oped12','text/html','http://connectiv.wordpress.com/2012/09/21/open-education-or-dumping-content-oped12/','open education;questions;open mooc;',NULL,NULL,38,NULL,NULL,NULL,57,'Some remarks on Slip Sliding Away: The Open in MOOC . * Is it an open course when you do not have to register?

We start with the negative non-A premise that words are not the un-speakable objective level, such as the actual objects outside of our skin and our personal feelings inside ourskin. It follows that the only link between the objective and the verbal world is exclusively structural, necessitating the conclusion that the only content of all &#8220;knowledge&#8221; is structural. Now structure can be considered as a complex of relations, and ultimately as multi-dimensional order.&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8216;Knowledge is literally the set of connections between entities. In humans, this knowledge consists of connections between neurons. In societies, this knowledge consists of connections between humans and their artifacts. What a network knows is not found in the content of its entities, nor in the content of messages sent from one to the other, but rather can only be found through recognition of patterns emergent in the network of connections and interactions.&#8217; Stephen Downes in <a href=\"http://www.downes.ca/files/Connective_Knowledge-19May2012.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Connectivism and Connective Knowledge: Essays on meaning and learning networks </a>(.pdf).</p>\n<p>image: <a href=\"http://www.friendsofart.net/static/images/art3/barnett-newman-white-fire-ii.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.friendsofart.net/static/images/art3/barnett-newman-white-fire-ii.jpg</a></p>\n<br /> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/connectiv.wordpress.com/2055/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/connectiv.wordpress.com/2055/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=connectiv.wordpress.com&#038;blog=19220396&#038;post=2055&#038;subd=connectiv&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(639,1,0,'OCL4Ed12-06 #OCL4Ed','text/html','http://connectiv.wordpress.com/2012/06/10/ocl4ed12-06-ocl4ed/','change11;education;moodle;',NULL,NULL,38,NULL,NULL,NULL,57,'Course on Open Content Licensing for Educators 20 June &#8211; 3 July 2012 The course is also on a wiki.

Cars weren&apos;t disruptive up until then because they were quite expensive. As a result, horses remained the main mode of transport until assembly lines made cars affordable and available to a broader segment of the population.<o:p></o:p>Why is it important for the average person to understand disruptive innovation?<o:p></o:p>It&apos;s important because it&apos;s happening faster and more often than it ever has in the history of humankind. That means we all need to get really good at being nimble and able to adapt to rapid changes.<o:p></o:p>For those resistant to change, things could get tough.<o:p></o:p>It&apos;s hard to ignore the increasing number of examples of disruptive technology that have changed our lives.<o:p></o:p>One of the first disruptive innovations I recall from my childhood was the transistor radio.<o:p></o:p>Being battery powered meant we could take our radios with us - thereby disrupting the need for plugged in music.

Cars weren&apos;t disruptive up until then because they were quite expensive. As a result, horses remained the main mode of transport until assembly lines made cars affordable and available to a broader segment of the population.<o:p></o:p>Why is it important for the average person to understand disruptive innovation?<o:p></o:p>It&apos;s important because it&apos;s happening faster and more often than it ever has in the history of humankind. That means we all need to get really good at being nimble and able to adapt to rapid changes.<o:p></o:p>For those resistant to change, things could get tough.<o:p></o:p>It&apos;s hard to ignore the increasing number of examples of disruptive technology that have changed our lives.<o:p></o:p>One of the first disruptive innovations I recall from my childhood was the transistor radio.<o:p></o:p>Being battery powered meant we could take our radios with us - thereby disrupting the need for plugged in music. Apple disrupted that innovation with their iPod and again with iTunes which distributed and monetized music. If the early attempts of tablet PCs were considered as an existing market,&amp;nbsp;Apple also had a major impact with their iPad.<o:p></o:p>Chances are Apple will do it again in the near future as they are planning to enter the TV market.<o:p></o:p><a href=\"http://ts4.mm.bing.net/images/thumbnail.aspx?q=4571619774562463&amp;amp;id=e6c5994b9258a87c25c908ec4ac6f9c5\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"240\" src=\"http://ts4.mm.bing.net/images/thumbnail.aspx?q=4571619774562463&amp;amp;id=e6c5994b9258a87c25c908ec4ac6f9c5\" style=\"background-color: transparent;\" width=\"320\" /></a>The World Book Encyclopedias that my parents scrimped and saved to buy us have now been displaced by Wikipedia.Other technologies such as Skype have replaced telephones which themselves replaced telegraphs.&amp;nbsp;<o:p></o:p>There are many disruptive innovations impacting education.

Â Goodness knows that so many people do and enjoy that. Â You can find Pinterest boards for any taste and desire.</p>\n<p>But, educators are also using this as a way to share resources for particular topics. Â It lets them focus on a theme and, at the same time, give the potential visitor a visual and text preview of what to expect should you click-through to the resource.</p>\n<p>I ran across a couple of very interesting boards today and I&#8217;d like to share them in this post. Â I think that they are good examples of what can be done in the world of sharing.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://pinterest.com/shellyterrell/digital-storytelling/\">Digital Storytelling<br />\n</a></strong>Shelly Terrell has assembled a nice selection of resources devoted to storytelling in the digital world.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" src=\"http://dougpete.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/shelly1.png?w=500&h=237\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"237\" /></p>\n<p>Sometimes people amass collections to try to have &#8220;every resource known to the digital universe&#8221;. Â When you do that and share it for others to use, they can be overwhelmed by the resource.</p>\n<p>In this case, Shelly has condensed the collection to 15 pins that should serve anyone interested in digital storytelling well.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://pinterest.com/petemcas/gis-ideas-for-k-12/\">GIS Ideas for K-12<br />\n</a></strong>Peter McAsh reminds all the time that he&#8217;s a Geography educator first and Computer Studies educator second! Â At this year&#8217;s Educational Computing Organization of Ontario&#8217;s Annual Conference, Peter has paired himself with James Lockyer to get people to<strong> <a href=\"http://lanyrd.com/2012/ecoo12/swbpk/\">think outside the Geography box when using GIS</a></strong>.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\" src=\"http://dougpete.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/peter.png?w=500\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" /></p>\n<p>To support his session, Peter has put together a similar number of resources of ideas for GIS in the K-12 classroom.</p>\n<p>If I can, I may just wander by that session to see what he&#8217;s up to.</p>\n<p>I like what Shelly and Peter are doing with Pinterest. Â It&#8217;s an updated way to share links and resources with other professionals. Â It is very easy to read and use and should serve their purposes well. Â I think both are good examples of why educators need to keep their minds open to new innovation in the online world. Â The next great thing will only be great if you embrace it and put it through its paces.

Teachers lack assessment training.</p>\n<p>2. Teacher training programs do not have curricular space (or priority) for assessment training.</p>\n<p>3. Assessment development is time consuming and often tedious.</p>\n<p>4. Teachers rely on test banks and other sources of assessment items that have unknown quality and alignment.</p>\n<p>5. Many teachers aren&#8217;t doing much to solve this problem. However, some teachers have started collaborative assessment development activities at the department, school or district levels. This means that some teachers, at least, are looking for ways to increase the test development efficiency and quality.</p>\n<p>6. Very few teachers obtain assessment training through professional development activities. Generally, teachers who do obtain some training are those who have been asked to help in the development of large-scale standardized tests. This kind of training has limited applicability at the classroom level.</p>\n<p>7. Teachers have limited access to high quality test items, but many teachers desire more access to such items.</p>\n<p>In addition, my conversations with these teachers (and other education experts) revealed at least one other critical reality:Â teachers often don&#8217;t know what they don&#8217;t know about assessment.</p>\n<p>It turns out that most teachers feel that they have sufficient capability in assessment development and evaluation. However, a few teachers that I talked to who had received minimal training (and one currently enrolled in a measurement Ph.D. program who has received significant training) were emphatic that their assessment knowledge prior to training was exceedingly limited but that they weren&#8217;t aware of the fact. What this means is that it will be critical to find the best way to help teachers realize the benefit that could be gained by using our product. One teacher (who is training to become a principal) recommended focusing our marketing toward administrators who, if bought-in, could persuade their teachers to use it. A second way to increase use would be to offer some sort of credit (college or licensure) for those who complete the training.</p>\n<p>Finally, most of the teachers I talked with gave very positive feedback about the idea itself, including saying things like &#8220;I would use your database&#8221; and &#8220;Your training and database would be so helpful to me and other teachers I know.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Photo Credit:Â <a href=\"http://www.innovationtools.com/\">http://www.innovationtools.com</a></p>\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,NULL),(693,0,0,'RT @cjgermano: RT @cjgermano: Reading up on ethics and copyright check out http://t.co/bg4iz82i and http://t.co/iYw6oPaS #oped12','twitter','http://twitter.com/paulasimoes/statuses/250979326726647808','edubloggers',NULL,NULL,342,'http://twitter.com/paulasimoes/statuses/250979326726647808',NULL,NULL,29,'RT @<a class=\" \" href=\"https://twitter.com/cjgermano\">cjgermano</a>: RT @<a class=\" \" href=\"https://twitter.com/cjgermano\">cjgermano</a>: Reading up on ethics and copyright check out <a href=\"http://t.co/bg4iz82i\">http://t.co/bg4iz82i</a> and <a href=\"http://t.co/iYw6oPaS\">http://t.co/iYw6oPaS</a> #<em>oped12</em>',1348697163,NULL,NULL,'paulasimoes','http://twitter.com/paulasimoes','Wed, 26 Sep 2012 15:25:09 +0000',NULL,'oped12 - Twitter Search',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(694,0,0,'RT @gsiemens: RT @gsiemens: We&apos;re going to do an #oped12 twitter chat on Thurs at 7 pm Mountain time.','twitter','http://twitter.com/cjgermano/statuses/250961237469450242','edubloggers',NULL,NULL,342,'http://twitter.com/cjgermano/statuses/250961237469450242',NULL,NULL,29,'RT @<a class=\" \" href=\"https://twitter.com/gsiemens\">gsiemens</a>: RT @<a class=\" \" href=\"https://twitter.com/gsiemens\">gsiemens</a>: We&apos;re going to do an #<em>oped12</em> twitter chat on Thurs at 7 pm Mountain time.',1348697164,NULL,NULL,'cjgermano','http://twitter.com/cjgermano','Wed, 26 Sep 2012 14:13:16 +0000',NULL,'oped12 - Twitter Search',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(695,0,0,'RT @gsiemens: We&apos;re going to do an #oped12 twitter chat on Thurs at 7 pm Mountain time. #TLTGmooc1','twitter','http://twitter.com/ifrank/statuses/251089241998766080','edubloggers',NULL,NULL,342,'http://twitter.com/ifrank/statuses/251089241998766080',NULL,NULL,29,'RT @<a class=\" \" href=\"https://twitter.com/gsiemens\">gsiemens</a>: We&apos;re going to do an #<em>oped12</em> twitter chat on Thurs at 7 pm Mountain time. <a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23TLTGmooc1\" title=\"#TLTGmooc1\" class=\" \">#TLTGmooc1</a>',1348703883,NULL,NULL,'ifrank','http://twitter.com/ifrank','Wed, 26 Sep 2012 22:41:54 +0000',NULL,'oped12 - Twitter Search',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(696,0,0,'Readings on blended learning with Creative Commons license Nice.

He has published on open education, Rhizomatic Learning, MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), Digital Identity, and practical classroom uses of virtual worlds.His educational journey started in 1998 teaching little children to speak English. The pivotal moment of his career happened when he was teaching at Hannam University in South Korea in 2003 surrounded by the papers of 275 writing students and wondering if he had them all. That winter he started using discussion forums to bring all of his students together in a writing community (and to digitally keep track of their work) and he hasn&apos;t looked back. He&apos;s since helped organize online communities of teachers, spoken at events around the world and worked to understand how internet changes what it means to know. His educational exploration partners have included faculty and researchers from well-known universities, and lone teachers in small town classrooms. Some of them are even still talking to him.Dave&apos;s keynotes in the last couple of years have centred around how coming to know is a messy, imprecise process at once intensely individual and necessarily embedded in a community &#8211; Rhizomatic Learning.

I am involved in the design, development and maintainance of online educational programs, and in teaching and research of the learning experiences. I am also currently carrying out research of open educational practices, such as Massive Open Online Courses and am involved in research in learning analytics. The research entails the use of qualitative measures and data mining. A virtual ethnography was one of the recent methods I used, and the data analyses involved qualitative data mining and social network analysis of large amounts of learner data and research in the ethics of using &apos;Big Data&apos; in research.</p>\n<p>Till August 2012 I worked as a researcher at the National Research council of Canada on their Personal Learning environment Project. I left Swansea University in the UK for three years to work on the research and development of these PLEs. In Swansea I was assistant professor in the Department of Adult Continuing Education. Apart from research and teaching my remit there was to widen access to Higher Education through &#8216;reaching in&#8217; activities of working with University departments in developing progression routes for non-traditional students. Prior to this I managed a number of large Widening Access outreach projects in South West Wales and the Valleys. These projects were dynamic collaborations between the department and community partners in South West Wales and often involved the use of technology. I developed their MA in Lifelong Learning programme.</p>\n<p>My career in education started as a teacher and head teacher of an infant school in Alphen aan den Rijn in the Netherlands. I am interested in lifelong learning from early years to old age and am a bit of a nomad; I enjoy travelling and learning about people and cultures, not only in an educational context.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://moocmadness.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/ignatia_inge_de_waard.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft\" style=\"border:0;\" src=\"http://moocmadness.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/ignatia_inge_de_waard.jpg?w=160&h=160\" alt=\"\" width=\"160\" height=\"160\" border=\"0\" /></a><strong>Inge Ignatia de Waard:Â </strong>At the moment I work as the elearning coordinator at the Institute of Tropical MedicineÂ Antwerpen (ITM), Belgium and I am involved in educational research with Athabasca UniversityÂ in Canada.

Having worked in and around IT for 20 years I&#8217;m also very interested in the subject matter &#8211; it was a nice blast from the past to read Eric Raymond&#8217;s brilliant &#8220;Cathedral and the Bazaar&#8221; article again (my ten years of coding life were spent very much in a corporate cathedral).</p>\n<p>And having signed up I&#8217;m going to give it a proper go. So I&#8217;ve made my first steps in open source software, building this little WordPress blog so I can add my tuppenceworth.</p>\n<p>I can imagine where potential problems lie &#8211; participants not engaging with the course or each other, no focussed discussion but rather a series of tangents, etc. I&#8217;m not sure how much MOOC organisers can do in facilitating some sort of synergy of ideas across the course. Also, I like to talk and discuss face to face, in a cafe, at work, at a conference. I&#8217;ll find it a bit strange trying to connect with people I&#8217;ve never met.</p>\n<p>But then it&#8217;s not as if the old pre-internet universities were a golden age of personal exchanges. Way back in the 70s when I did my philosophy degree I spent my first year in lecture theatres of 200+ students being talked at by turgid lecturers who&#8217;d probably been doing the same presentation for decades. There was no engagement with the class, nor with individual students, nor any structure to facilitate the students themselves getting together to discuss ideas.

Â I can&#8217;t believe that it&#8217;s been almost a year since I reviewed and <strong><a href=\"http://dougpete.wordpress.com/2011/10/16/cube-for-k-12-teachers/\">blogged</a></strong> about the initial release of the online resource. Â At the time, there was a concern from a reader that the service would become pay for use and Cube for Teachers replied that they would remain free and there&#8217;s no indication that has changed.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The concept of groups really leverages the service.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It now goes beyond the original concept of a repository &#8211; now you can use the area as a collaboration space for writing teams, planning groups, NTIP, &#8230; Â Rather than rehashing my thoughts, what follows below is the announcement from <strong><a href=\"http://www.cubeforteachers.com/\">Cube for Teachers</a></strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There are a lot of repositories online but this grouping feature makes the Cube for Teachers really unique. Â Keep that in mind if you&#8217;re ever working on a project that requires pulling resources together. Â Even if you&#8217;re not ready for that yet, it&#8217;s still a nicely organized resource for Ontario teachers.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">As over 1800 teachers across the province have already discovered, Cube for Teachers allows teachers to search for, share, and save links to internet resources which will help them meet the needs of their students.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And now, Cube for Teachers has introduced a powerful new feature:Â  Groups. Teachers across the province can now invite other teachers to form professional learning networks (PLNs) inside Cube for Teachers.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Group feature within Cube for Teachers can be used:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">a) Â  Â  to share resources<br />\nb) Â  Â  to share teaching ideas<br />\nc) Â  Â  for professional development<br />\nd) Â  Â  as a forum for discussions on important educational topics</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Reasons Why Educators Will Want to Use the Groups Feature:</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">1.Â Â Â Â  Ontario teachers can now connect with others throughout the province on specific topics or other areas of interest.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">2.Â Â Â Â  School departments can collaborate on resources for various courses.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">3.Â Â Â Â  School administrators can invite their staff to form groups for professional development.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">4.Â Â Â Â  Subject Council members can share ideas, resource links and next steps.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">5.Â Â Â Â  Administrators can form PLNs with other administrators.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">6.Â Â Â Â  School Family representatives can support each other and share ideas.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">7.Â Â Â Â  Faculties of Education instructors can establish networks for their teacher candidates to share ideas, resource links, and support each other.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">8.Â Â Â Â  New teachers (NTIP) can offer support and ideas for each other.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">9.Â Â Â Â  Teachers can form groups to continue collaborating after an in-service.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">10. Â  The Groups Feature helps make Cube for Teachers the one-stop shop for Ontario teachers to collaborate!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We welcome all Ontario educators to register with Cube For Teachers and try our latest feature! Remember that The Cube is a secure community designed exclusively for Ontario teachers. Teacher can search for, share, and save links based on grade, course, subject, and expectations based on the Ontario Curriculum.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And please, spread the word!Â  Refer a friend.

Â She&apos;s never been hesitant about exploring and trying new things as long as it had direct benefits for her students. Â I had the wonderful opportunity to interview her for the blog.</p>\n<p>Welcome, Aviva. Â Thanks for taking the time for this interview. Â I think many of my blog readers are very familiar with your online digital presence and will read with interest. Â Hopefully, they&apos;ll gain some insights about what makes you and your classrooms tick.</p>\n<p>Aviva: Thanks for this incredible opportunity Doug!</p>\n<p>Doug: Â First &#8211; you made the Twitter change from @Grade1 to @AvivaLoca. Â Can you tell us why you made the name change and how you finally decided on @AvivaLoca?</p>\n<p>Aviva: I joined Twitter when I moved from teaching Senior Kindergarten to teaching Grade 1, and even when I became a Grade Â½ teacher, I decided to stick with @grade1 because I thought that it encapsulated me as a \"primary teacher.\" This year though, I made the move to Grade 6, and I knew that my name needed to change. I didn&apos;t want to pick a name that just associated me with a particular grade, as I&apos;ve learned that grades can change. I was really vacillating of a name though, so I decided to harness the power of social media and run a poll on my blog. I provided some name choices, but @avivaloca was actually suggested in addition to the ones I provided. I LOVED it! The name makes me giggle each time I read it, and I love to laugh. I wasn&apos;t really set on it though until one educator said that the Grade 6&apos;s would probably love it most of all. I always say that I do everything for students first, so it was when this teacher said this, that I knew @avivaloca would be my new Twitter handle. I felt like the Grade 6&apos;s had a \"voice\" in this decision too!</p>\n<p>Doug: Â This year has been a big change for you. Â You&#8217;re now in a Grade 6 classroom after years teaching Grade 1. Â Why the big switch?</p>\n<p>Aviva: I think change is good, and I was definitely at a point in my career where I wanted a change. My administrators are incredibly supportive and were willing to give me this new teaching opportunity, and I would actually get to teach many of my first group of JK students from this school. I knew that I needed to take this opportunity while I had it!</p>\n<p>I love working in education, and I look forward to a very long career in it! I don&apos;t know what the future holds in terms of new opportunities though, and this junior experience is a good one. I&apos;m very glad I made the big switch!</p>\n<p>Doug: Â How&#8217;s it going?</p>\n<p>Aviva: It&apos;s going amazingly well! I love working with the older students. I have such a bright, engaging, fantastic group of Grade 6 students that constantly push my thinking every day. I know that I&apos;m a better teacher because of this change, and even more so, because of them!</p>\n<p>Doug: Â In your blog, you have always been very transparent and shared a great deal of your teaching experiences. Â One of the ideas you&#8217;ve shared recently is that you&#8217;re using Royan Lee&#8217;s concept of a Thinking Book. Â What made you decide to use that? Â Are you having success with it?</p>\n<p>Aviva: I loved Royan&apos;s Thinking Book concept! I use lots of technology in the classroom, and students often publish their work online. I like to bridge the gap between paper and pencil and the computer, and I thought that the Thinking Book would do this. Students are now brainstorming their ideas on paper regardless of the tool that they use to publish their work. The Thinking Book is also allowing them to see the benefit in pre-planning and thinking in all subject matters. Students really enjoy having this consistent tool to share their ideas, and they&apos;re using their Thinking Books both when guided to do so, and through independent choice. I&apos;m thrilled with the results!</p>\n<p>Doug: Â Moving from Grade 1 to Grade 6 will also mean moving to a different classroom. Â What do you find are the biggest differences between last year and this?</p>\n<p>Aviva: I think it&apos;s the marking. It never stops! <img src=&apos;http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif&apos; alt=&apos;:)&apos; class=&apos;wp-smiley&apos; /> Last year, I had a lot more prep work to do, but my marking was less, or at least it didn&apos;t take as long. This year, it&apos;s reversed. That&apos;s okay though: each grade comes with its own unique bonuses and challenges. </p>\n<p>Doug: Â In Grade 1, you took many opportunities to merge social media into your teaching. Â I&#8217;m thinking in particular your experiences with quad-blogging and Twitter. Â Are you able to do the same things this year?</p>\n<p>Aviva: Yes, absolutely!! In some ways, even more so. Many students bring their own devices that they use in the classroom, which just makes access to these tools even easier. The students will be getting their own blogs next week, they&apos;re already using Twitter to share and connect with others, and they&apos;re using our class blog as well. We also start the Global Read Aloud next week (thanks Pernille Ripp (@pernilleripp)), so the students will be using Edmodo as well.</p>\n<p>Doug: Â What&#8217;s the difference between the use and supervision of students using the internet in primary versus junior grades?</p>\n<p>Aviva: Students are much more comfortable with the Internet in these older grades, and they know how to use it well. That being said, their ease of use makes supervision even more key. There&apos;s also a big need for \"education.\" Students realize that many of these tools are public ones, but they need some instruction on what public means. They&apos;re very open to instruction though, and what they can do online is truly incredible!</p>\n<p>Doug: Â How about other software packages? Â What would you say have been the really useful software packages that you&#8217;ve brought into your class so far?</p>\n<p>Aviva: I really haven&apos;t used much software in the classroom. I&apos;d be open for suggestions though. Many of my computers in the classroom make downloading difficult, so I rely on \"cloud computer.\"</p>\n<p>Doug: Â What are you planning for the future?</p>\n<p>Aviva: This is a hard question. I definitely plan on being in education. I LOVE teaching right now, and I may continue teaching for the rest of my career. I also love working with other teachers and administrators though, especially in the area of technology in education. I would definitely consider a consultant-type position in the future, if the opportunity presented itself. Being able to blend working with students and working with educators would be ideal!</p>\n<p>Doug: Â There must be a whole new set of planning and preparation needed in your new world. Â We always talk about networks to learn from. Â What sort of networking have you used to kick start your Grade 6 experience?</p>\n<p>Aviva: I&apos;ve used a number this year. I have a fantastic teaching partner, who I worked with before in Grade 1. She&apos;s been a Literacy Teacher for our Board though, and has lots of junior experience. We have planned a lot together. I&apos;ve also worked with some amazing Grade 5 and 6 teachers from a neighbouring school. We&apos;ve been able to plan together and share ideas. This has been very beneficial. Finally, I&apos;ve had tons of support from my awesome PLN on Twitter! I follow tons of junior teachers, who have been very willing to share ideas and offer support. I can&apos;t thank them enough!</p>\n<p>Doug: Â Grade 6 is a testing year for EQAO. Â That&#8217;s not something that you&#8217;ve had to plan for in Grade 1! Â Do you find preparing for EQAO impacting your lesson planning? Â Where are you turning for support?</p>\n<p>Aviva: EQAO has definitely been something I&apos;ve been thinking about since September. I&apos;ve certainly looked at all of the previous tests online, and have used what I&apos;ve learned from this exploration in my planning and teaching. Each Monday, my teaching partner and I do an #mcmondays Twitter chat (we even trended two weeks ago) where we tweet out old EQAO multiple choice questions, and students work in partners to tweet the answers. They discuss the different possibilities, and really have a chance to break down the questions. My teaching partner and I also use old EQAO reading passages for reading comprehension activities. This gets the students used to the format that they&apos;re going to see on EQAO. As we told the students, we&apos;re trying to demystify it, so that EQAO is just another thing to do in class. Weekly, we also send home open response questions for writing questions, and we use similar questions in class. We show the students how to approach these questions, and give them a chance to practice the skill. A fellow Grade 6 teacher in our Board gave us a great format for how to answer these open response questions (thanks @michellefawcett), and we taught the students this approach to help them. Between Twitter and real life interactions, there&apos;s always lots of teachers around willing to share ideas and offer help! Yes, EQAO is a definite presence in the classroom, but learning in our Grade 6 classes is about way more than this too!</p>\n<p>Doug: Â I can imagine that this has been a pretty intense start to the school year. Â Are you up for another year of Grade 6?</p>\n<p>Aviva: I definitely am! It has been a busy start, but doing something again is always wonderful. It gives you a chance to reflect on what you did before, make changes, and try again. I&apos;m always up for trying again!</p>\n<p>Doug: Â Finally, you&#8217;re part of the Minds on Media event for this year&#8217;s ECOO (Educational Computing Organization of Ontario) Conference. Â Can you tell us what your centre will be about? Â If I dropped in, what would I expect to learn?</p>\n<p>Aviva: Strangely enough, my centre will be about documenting student learning in the K-3 classroom. These ideas could definitely be applied to junior classrooms as well though. I&apos;m looking at how teachers can use technology to document student achievement. We&apos;ll be looking at various online tools teachers can use with all students (e.g., blogs, Evernote, the Livescribe Pen, etc.), and how the teachers can use them for documentation as well as how they can empower the students to use them to document their own learning. I&apos;m so excited for this amazing opportunity!</p>\n<p>Doug: Â Thank you so much, Aviva. Â I&#8217;m sure that all the blog readers wish you a successful year. Â Personally, I&#8217;m looking forward to catching up in Richmond Hill at the conference.</p>\n<p>Aviva: Thanks Doug!

Rostock): Is Social Online Based Learning the Cure for Knowledge Poverty?</h3>\n<p>Tavangarian starts his talk to define technical knowledge as \"Know what\" and \"know how\". He states that today&apos;s learners suffer of knowledge poverty. Knowledge poverty is caused by restricted access to information and information overload. Learners are distracted by media consumption. There exits knowledge poverty in developing and emerging countries. Knowledge poverty rises from deficiency in the educational system.</p>\n<p>Is E-Learning an instrument to avoid knowledge poverty? Mostly e-learning automates the classroom model, but learners have the freedom of place and time. A lot of money for e-learning is spent in Germany, but at this time e-learning is not enough.</p>\n<p>Tavangarian asks, if social learning is a way to learn with more effectiveness. Today&apos;s technology gives flexibility in learning supporting communication and cooperation, as well as international networks. There are many social media systems which can enhance e-learning.</p>\n<p>So what is needed? According to Tavangarian there is a need for an integrated platform of key social media tools which could provide a secure space for networking and sharing, it is a combination of LMS, content provider (repository) and social media.</p>\n<p>Tavangarian and his teams is working on <a href=\"wiki-learnia.org\">WIKI-Learnia</a>, a learning system for digital natives, which delivers the necessary knowledge for personal competences. It offers formal and informal, supported and unsupported, personal and social learning. Â Learners can work as authors, tutors, assessors, ...</p>\n<h3>My conclusion</h3>\n<p>Wheelers presentation was interesting and I loved his pictures and stories. I&#8217;m impressed how technology involves and personally I&#8217;m using my iPhone, my netbook, my computer all the time &#8211; and some times ago I started to use web services where my rights as author are not protected at all. These services are so easy to Â use and it&#8217;s so nice to communicate and collaborate with all these people in the net. Nevertheless I don&#8217;t want to loose the total control about my life &#8211; and I don&#8217;t want to immagine a fridge who speaks with me and orders my food (probably influenced by smart advertising). But who knows what will happen in the next years &#8230;</p>\n<p>At the beginning I liked Tavangarian&#8217;s talk as well, he asked interesting questions and reflected learning processes in higher education. But I was not convinced by his closed platform which should combine LMS with social media &#8211; Â isn&#8217;t social media about openess and what about open ressources and open courses (e.g. MOOCS)?</p>\n<br /> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/zmldidaktik.wordpress.com/557/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/zmldidaktik.wordpress.com/557/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=zmldidaktik.wordpress.com&#038;blog=17426790&#038;post=557&#038;subd=zmldidaktik&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,NULL),(755,0,0,'RT @gsiemens: RT @gsiemens: Universities running MOOCs \"their own worst enemy\" http://t.co/DWqlFcUZ #oped12 #mooc','twitter','http://twitter.com/jduart/statuses/251693362413989888','edubloggers',NULL,NULL,342,'http://twitter.com/jduart/statuses/251693362413989888',NULL,NULL,29,'RT @<a class=\" \" href=\"https://twitter.com/gsiemens\">gsiemens</a>: RT @<a class=\" \" href=\"https://twitter.com/gsiemens\">gsiemens</a>: Universities running MOOCs \"their own worst enemy\" <a href=\"http://t.co/DWqlFcUZ\">http://t.co/DWqlFcUZ</a> #<em>oped12</em> <a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23mooc\" title=\"#mooc\" class=\" \">#mooc</a>',1348845243,NULL,NULL,'jduart','http://twitter.com/jduart','Fri, 28 Sep 2012 14:42:28 +0000',NULL,'oped12 - Twitter Search',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(756,0,0,'Universities running MOOCs \"their own worst enemy\" http://t.co/DWqlFcUZ #oped12 #mooc','twitter','http://twitter.com/gsiemens/statuses/251679550315061248','edubloggers',NULL,NULL,342,'http://twitter.com/gsiemens/statuses/251679550315061248',NULL,NULL,29,'Universities running MOOCs \"their own worst enemy\" <a href=\"http://t.co/DWqlFcUZ\">http://t.co/DWqlFcUZ</a> #<em>oped12</em> <a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23mooc\" title=\"#mooc\" class=\" \">#mooc</a>',1348845243,NULL,NULL,'gsiemens','http://twitter.com/gsiemens','Fri, 28 Sep 2012 13:47:35 +0000',NULL,'oped12 - Twitter Search',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(757,10,0,'Take it for granted: OpEd is here &#8230; to stay','text/html','http://www.reimerth.com/2012/09/take-it-for-granted-oped-is-here-to-stay/','Lernen (das eigene);Open Education;#oped12;learni.st;category',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,58,'Lets face it: Open education takes place!

Â After all, you or your school have a website. Â It may be just a template with your school colours but you&#8217;re on the web. Â You&#8217;re telling your parents and your students your staff list and bell times. Â If that makes you feel good, then you need to next read this post from George Couros. Â It&#8217;s entitled &#8220;<strong><a title=\"Don&apos;t use 2.0 technology in a 1.0 way\" href=\"http://smartblogs.com/education/2012/09/26/dont-use-2-0-technology-1-0-way/\" rel=\"bookmark\">Don&apos;t use 2.0 technology in a 1.0 way</a></strong>&#8220;.</p>\n<p>Maybe, it&#8217;s time to step away from the keyboard and think this through carefully.</p>\n<p>As a basis for a discussion, I&#8217;d like to consider the classroom instruction &#8220;I want you to do a Powerpoint&#8221;. Â Is that even 1.0? Â Well, you could be using your SkyDrive account. Â And, if this is a class on how to use Powerpoint, it might be appropriate. Â But, is the real instruction &#8220;I want you to create a presentation&#8221;. Â That sheds a whole new light on the discussion. Â Your third step is to read this post. Â <strong><a href=\"http://www.fluency21.com/blogpost.cfm?blogID=2980\">8 Unique Online Presentation Tools for Students</a></strong>. Â I know that I read somewhere that someone found these &#8220;# ways to&#8221; as being lazy. Â Maybe it&#8217;s time to think that it instead, multiple offerings could serve as a vehicle to open a lot of doors.</p>\n<p>Is it necessary that students know all 8? Â No, but what if they did or could or would given the opportunity. Â Maybe they would find a tool that is more attractive to them or more suitableÂ for the delivery of their message? Â What is the ultimate expectation &#8211; that students create a Powerpoint presentation for their presentation or that students create a presentation for their presentation? Â What does opening the door to other web2.0 technologies offer? Â Easy integration of media for their message, online collaboration with their friends, sharing and feedback before, during or after the presentation. Â Does it not make sense?</p>\n<p>So, let&#8217;s head back to your or your school&#8217;s web presence and think about George&#8217;s thoughts. Â Does it take you where you need it to go? Â Is it just a dispenser of information? Â Or, is it more of a conversation? Â Think about your classroom activities. Â Do the same principles apply? Â I think that George&#8217;s post should really make you think and wonder just how effectively you are using things?</p>\n<p>John Seely Brown will appear as a keynote and panel discussion member at the <strong><a href=\"http://www.ecoo.org\">ECOO Conference</a></strong> in Richmond Hill in October.</p>\n<br /> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/dougpete.wordpress.com/11150/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/dougpete.wordpress.com/11150/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=dougpete.wordpress.com&#038;blog=2477343&#038;post=11150&#038;subd=dougpete&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,NULL),(769,0,0,'It&apos;s time to re-think about education models  #mooc #oped12 http://t.co/qIN4Ja3T','twitter','http://twitter.com/suifaijohnmak/statuses/252048333504389122','edubloggers',NULL,NULL,342,'http://twitter.com/suifaijohnmak/statuses/252048333504389122',NULL,NULL,29,'It&apos;s time to re-think about education models <a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23mooc\" title=\"#mooc\" class=\" \">#mooc</a> #<em>oped12</em> <a href=\"http://t.co/qIN4Ja3T\">http://t.co/qIN4Ja3T</a>',1348930203,NULL,NULL,'suifaijohnmak','http://twitter.com/suifaijohnmak','Sat, 29 Sep 2012 14:13:00 +0000',NULL,'oped12 - Twitter Search',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'none',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(770,1,0,'English 2.0','Diigo','http://www.scoop.it/t/english-2-0','edubloggers',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,30,'<p><strong>Comments:</strong><ul><li>the benefits of technology for educators OPENBLOCKPage 1CLOSEBLOCK - <small><a href=&quot;http://groups.diigo.com/group/oped12/content/user/leonardopena&quot;

coding &#8211; you&#8217;ll find that there are a number of posts giving &#8220;## reasons to teach coding to students&#8221;.Â  Some talk about it generally so that it could be understood that it should be taught somewhere in a child&#8217;s educational career and others specifically make reference to why you&#8217;d want to teach coding in elementary schools.Â  My preference would be, given the large number of places that computers are used in other ways in the curriculum, that the earlier the better.</p>\n<p>But the kids aren&#8217;t ready!Â  Really?Â  How many have helped mom and dad program their smartphone?Â  How many have their own and have customized it to their liking.Â  They&#8217;re already tinkering and learning.Â  They are ready.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a firm believer that since we&#8217;re big fans of technology, we really want to ensure that students become educated users of the technology, and part of that is to just get a sense of what it&#8217;s all about.Â  Now, I don&#8217;t think that we&#8217;re expecting our students to create the next great web browser, but there&#8217;s so much value in knowing what coding is all about and a sense of how it&#8217;s done.Â  I&#8217;ve mentioned it in this blog before but I really believe in the message of Douglas Rushkoff&#8217;s &#8220;<strong><a href=\"http://www.rushkoff.com/program-or-be-programmed/\">Program or be Programmed</a></strong>&#8220;.Â  Your school&#8217;s teacher-librarian needs to have a copy of that in your professional library.</p>\n<p>Through the introduction of this awareness, it also opens the doors to the whole discipline where the students just may wish to extend their abilities.</p>\n<p>The real question, to me, remains largely unanswered.Â  Where should coding, as an introduction to computer science, be introduced?Â  It&#8217;s amazing the number of teachers who will agree that it&#8217;s a good skill to have as long as someone else introduces it!</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been playing around with <strong><a href=\"http://www.crunchzilla.com/code-monster\">Code Monster from Crunchzilla</a></strong> and can see where it may solve the problem for implementation.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img style=\"margin:5px;\" src=\"http://dougpete.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/about.png?w=506&h=232\" alt=\"\" width=\"506\" height=\"232\" /></p>\n<p>Code Monster is a number of things.Â  It&#8217;s an environment to learn about Javascript (not to be confused with Java), it&#8217;s a play as you go tutorial, it&#8217;s a place to see immediate results for instant feedback, and it&#8217;s a conversation with a monster who steps you through the process.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img style=\"margin:5px;\" src=\"http://dougpete.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/monster.png?w=550&h=362\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"362\" /></p>\n<p>The use of the tutorial provides feedback to the learner and gives an instant sense of achievement.Â  Recently, I tried it out here at dougpete labs.Â  (which is really a couch and two recliner chairs with a dog who wants to be part of everything)Â  Within minutes, my guinea pig made the comment &#8220;Hey, I could actually do this &#8230; it isn&#8217;t all that hard.&#8221;Â  The more I started to think about Code Monster, the more I liked it.</p>\n<p>As a beginning learning environment, you&#8217;re not presented with a large confusing interface with a tonne of options like you would find in a professional IDE and the concept of the code in one window and the results in another window right beside generates that instant feeling of gratification that comes from writing good code.</p>\n<p>With your friendly monster leading the way, learning is quick, efficient, and fun.Â  The deeper you get into the tutorials, the more you want to experience.</p>\n<p>I can see an application like this having multiple entry points in schools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in a computer studies class, an introduction to Javascript with a proceed at your own pace functionality;</li>\n<li>in an elementary school classroom, where the desire is there to easily introduce coding to students;</li>\n<li>in a computer club where students learn the concepts on their own in a group setting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Working through the tutorial with the monster will indeed give a sense of what coding is about and hopefully generate enough interest to take on something else.Â  There is so much available once you get started &#8211; Scratch, Alice, GameMaker &#8211; and a good start to coding is a great way to ensure success.</p>\n<p style=\"color:#008;text-align:right;\"><small><em>Powered by</em> <a href=\"http://www.qumana.com/\">Qumana</a></small></p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://glinden.blogspot.com/2012/09/code-monster-and-teaching-programming.html\" target=\"_blank\">Code Monster and teaching programming to kids</a> (glinden.blogspot.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://alfredtwo.blogspot.com/2012/09/interesting-links-10-september-2012.html\" target=\"_blank\">Interesting Links 10 September 2012</a> (alfredtwo.blogspot.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.good.is/post/khan-academy-wants-to-teach-you-coding/\" target=\"_blank\">Khan Academy Wants to Teach You Coding</a> (good.is)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://ejohn.org/blog/introducing-khan-cs/\" target=\"_blank\">Redefining the Introduction to Computer Science</a> (ejohn.org)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://developers.slashdot.org/story/12/09/12/0048209/is-a-computer-science-degree-worth-getting-anymore\" target=\"_blank\">Is a Computer Science Degree Worth Getting Anymore?</a> (developers.slashdot.org)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/14/khan-academy-launches-the-future-of-computer-science-education/\" target=\"_blank\">Khan Academy Launches The Future of Computer Science Education</a> (techcrunch.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<br /> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/dougpete.wordpress.com/11158/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/dougpete.wordpress.com/11158/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=dougpete.wordpress.com&#038;blog=2477343&#038;post=11158&#038;subd=dougpete&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Fresh',NULL,NULL),(787,0,0,'My post for #oped12 about creative commons licensing, moocification, and putting it all into practice.

This week&apos;s blog originates from three seemingly unrelated experiences last week which, on closer reflection, present an interesting lens through which to look at recent developments in higher and distance education. These three experiences also provide some sense of a possible future gestalt of higher and distance education.</p>\n<p>In a course (OMDE603) I am doing through the University of Maryland University College (UMUC), I had to reflect on the different possibilities for and challenges in using asynchronous and synchronous technologies in distance education contexts. I also registered for the <a href=\"http://http://open.mooc.ca/\">Open MOOC</a> offered by George Siemens and Rory McGreal exploring the history of open education. The third experience comprised an engagement with a school in my home institution reflecting on concerns about the number of our students who don&apos;t complete a three-year bachelor degree in <em>eight</em> years&apos; time.</p>\n<p>Let us take student success at an imaginary higher distance education institution as an example<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a>. It will not be out of the ordinary for over 20% of students registering for a general bachelor degree to <em>not</em> register for a second consecutive year. After eight years, over 40% of the initial cohort is no longer in the system and have dropped out, just over 20% have graduated and another 30% of the initial cohort is still in the system. Â From my understanding of student success in distance education, high dropout rates seem to be endemic in all higher distance education institutions (e.g. Woodley 2004). While comparative statistics between distance education institutions are hard (if not impossible) to obtain, one is anyway never certain whether you compare apples with apples as contexts, programme qualification mixes (PQM) and curricula differ, and cohorts are defined and measured differently. Woodley (2004) also warns that we should furthermore not pathologize student dropout in distance education programmes â€“ student dropout is part of the DNA of higher distance education as students register and de-register for a variety of reasons.Â  Reasons mentioned by Woodley (2004) why students dropout from distance education programmes are, inter alia:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Students no longer register for a particular qualification or programme, so anything like a graduation rate is almost impossible to calculate</li>\n<li>Dropout has to be extended to consider those students who finish one course or module but who do not continue to study immediately</li>\n<li>Students can leave with interim qualifications such as certificates, diplomas or just course credits and be \"successful\" in their own terms</li>\n<li>Students can transfer to other institutions to complete their learning</li>\n<li>Students can take as many years off as they like before returning (p.55)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is furthermore evidence (see e.g. Subotzky &amp; Prinsloo, 2011) that <em>non-academic</em> factors such as changes in students&apos; life-worlds, institutional inefficiencies and macro-societal factors, etc., impact more on students&apos; decisions to dropout or stop-out than academic factors. The high dropout rate in higher distance education should therefore not be used as evidence that students studying through distance and open learning are of lesser quality or have less potential than students in residential universities. Distance education also attracts different types of students making any comparison between pass rates in residential and distance education institutions superficial.</p>\n<p>Despite the above reasons prompting us not to jump to conclusions about cohort success (or lack of success) in higher distance education; we have nagging a concern that there must be some things we can do to improve cohort success in higher distance education. If we consider student retention and success as originating from mostly non-linear, multidimensional, interdependent interactions at different phases in the nexus between student, institution and broader societal factors, it is clear that we should not claim, too easily, that our interventions cause less dropouts. Let me explain...</p>\n<p>While cohort retention and success rates in the above imaginary higher distance education institution are worrying, a seemingly contradictory element is the fact that the pass rate for students in <em>individual</em> courses is above 60%. Students therefore pass individual courses, but don&apos;t complete their qualifications or take an extraordinary long time to graduate. While most of our institutional and faculty efforts are aimed on course level (e.g. offering extra tuition opportunities, extra materials and using a range of technologies, etc.), the problem does not, necessarily, lie on individual course level but in the links between courses, specific modules which are barriers to graduation and possibly, the total configuration of courses constituting a diploma or degree. Considering that most undergraduate degree programmes at this imaginary higher distance education institution comprise of 30-plus courses, it would therefore seem as if we need to think differently about the <em>total</em> student journey.</p>\n<p>If we accept that most distance education students take about half of the course load per year than residential students, it seems reasonable that distance education students complete a three-year bachelor degree programme in six years. If we consider that students don&apos;t pass all of their courses all the time and may repeat courses, then eight years for a thee-year undergraduate qualification does not seem to be unreasonable. How does this explain the 40% dropout and 30% that take longer to complete (if they do)? It doesn&#8217;t&#8230;</p>\n<p>If this line of reasoning holds potential for further reflection, let us then consider the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Considering how much our lives change over a period of 8 years, how many of our distance education students know that they are in for a <em>very</em> long journey? How does <em>anyone</em> plan for the next 8 years?</li>\n<li>By the time students reach their eighth year &apos;in the system&apos; â€“ how much of their course content and skills have become obsolete?</li>\n<li>What happens to curriculum coherence over a period of eight years?</li>\n<li>With obsolescence of skills and knowledge becoming an increasing reality, what are the implications for the way we construct curricula if students don&apos;t complete the full intended journeys and either leave earlier and never complete, or take longer to complete?</li>\n<li>Can students (and higher education institutions) still afford to think in terms of full degree programmes consisting of 30-plus modules or courses? For many years &apos;bildung&apos; was seen as the outcome for an entire undergraduate qualification. What does &apos;bildung&apos; look like in a digital super-complex age? Is it still realistic (if it ever was...) to think of &apos;bildung&apos; as the outcome of a 30-course learning journey ?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Up to now the undergraduate degree as a composite 30-something qualification stands unchallenged as <em>the basis</em> for higher education. I therefore want to propose that we need to seriously reconsider the nature and scope of our qualification structures and learning journeys. Not only does our cohort analyses tell us that we need to think differently about the structure of our offerings; the demand for shorter, asynchronous and just-in-time learning is increasing by the day. While these types of courses and qualifications have always been part of the bigger higher education landscape, these courses have recently become en vogue with offerings by EdX, Udacity, Coursera, OER Africa, and the Khan Academy (to mention but a few). Though the structure of these offerings questions some of our basic assumptions regarding qualification structure, assessment and accreditation, there is another trend that necessitates an urgent rethink.</p>\n<p>Private, for-profit higher education is growing at an unprecedented rate claiming an ever-increasing elitist space for those who can afford synchronous education with a huge price tag. Pearsons and other publishing houses are increasingly offering curricula, and assessment and accreditation may not be very far off. This is in stark contrast to the huge need for more access and more affordable education for thousands of learners who will never have the resources or the time to afford and attend private higher education.This has an eerie resemblance to the work of Naomi Klein on <a href=\"http://www.naomiklein.org/shock-doctrine\">\"the shock doctrine\"</a> â€“ where neoliberal disaster capitalism offers salvation to disaster stricken areas and populations.</p>\n<p>While more and more higher and distance education institutions buckle under the strains of changing funding regimes, under-prepared students <em>and</em> faculty, Â we will have to rethink some of our basic assumptions about teaching and learning, our qualification structures, organisational ecologies and business modules. My gut feeling is that we can no longer afford 30-plus module/course undergraduate degrees. We need shorter learning trajectories allowing learners to plan for and complete before adding another just-in-time learning experiences based on real-time needs.</p>\n<p><strong>In conclusion:</strong>Â  The illustration at the beginning of the blog has four elements namely just in case, just in time, just enough and just for me. I suspect it is no longer true. For years we promoted and afforded the undergraduate synchronous bachelor degrees as a \"just in case\" scenario where students can find themselves before moving on to more specialized fields. Somehow we believed that a compilation and completion of 30-odd courses will result in a particular understanding of &apos;bildung&apos;, provide a passport to the &apos;good life&apos; and employment. None of these three envisaged outcomes are necessarily true anymore...Â  I would propose the following: <a href=\"http://opendistanceteachingandlearning.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/need-to-know.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-438\" title=\"Need to know\" src=\"http://opendistanceteachingandlearning.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/need-to-know.jpg?w=640&h=274\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"274\" /></a></p>\n<p>This may furthermore collapse the dichotomy between formal and informal learning â€“ which is most probably a leftover from a pre-digital age...</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>Subotzky, G., &amp; Prinsloo, P.
