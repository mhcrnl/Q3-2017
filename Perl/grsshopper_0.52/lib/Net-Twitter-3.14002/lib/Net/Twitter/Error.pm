=head1 NAME

Net::Twitter::Error - A Net::Twitter exception object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $nt = Net::Twitter->new(username => $username, password => $password);

    my $followers = eval { $nt->followers };
    if ( my $err = $@ ) {
        die $@ unless blessed $err and $err->isa('Net::Twitter::Error');

        warn "HTTP Response Code: ", $err->code, "\n",
             "HTTP Message......: ", $err->message, "\n",
             "Twitter error.....: ", $err->error, "\n";
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Net::Twitter::Error> encapsulates the C<HTTP::Response> and Twitter
error HASH (if any) resulting from a failed API call.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new

Constructs a C<Net::Twitter::Error> object.  It accepts the following parameters:

=over 4

=item http_response

An C<HTTP::Response> object, required.

=item twitter_error

The error returned by Twitter as a HASH ref.  Optional, since some API errors do
not include a response from Twitter.  They may, instead, be the result of network
timeouts, proxy errors, or some other problem that prevents an API response.

=back

=item twitter_error

Get or set the Twitter error HASH.

=item http_response

Get or set the C<HTTP::Response> object.

=item code

Returns the HTTP response code.

=item message

Returns the HTTP response message.

=item has_twitter_error

Returns true if the object contains a Twitter error HASH.

=item error

Returns the C<error> value from the C<twitter_error> HASH ref if there is one.
Otherwise, it returns the string "[unknown]".
