=head1 NAME

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::Twitter;

  $nt = Net::Twitter::Search->new;

  $tweets = $nt->search('perl_api');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module simply creates an instance of C<Net::Twitter> with the C<Legacy>
trait for backwards compatibility with prior versions.  Consider
L<Net::Twitter::Lite> if you need a lighter, non-Moose alternative.

See L<Net::Twitter> for full documentation.

=head1 DEPRECATION NOTICE

This module is deprecated.  Use L<Net::Twitter> instead.

    use Net::Twitter;

    # Just the Search API; exceptions thrown on error
    $nt = Net::Twitter->new(traits => [qw/API::Search/]);

    # Just the Search API; errors wrapped - use $nt->get_error
    $nt = Net::Twitter->new(traits => [qw/API::Search WrapError/]);

    # Or, for code that uses legacy Net::Twitter idioms
    $nt = Net::Twitter->new(traits => [qw/Legacy/]);

    $tweets = $nt->search('pot of gold');
