=head1 NAME

Net::Twitter::Role::WrapError - Wraps Net::Twitter exceptions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Net::Twitter;

    my $nt = Net::Twitter->new(username => $username, password => $password);

    my $followers = $nt->followers;
    if ( !followers ) {
        warn $nt->http_message;
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an alternate error handling strategy for C<Net::Twitter>.
Rather than throwing exceptions, API methods return C<undef> and error
information is available through method calls on the C<Net::Twitter> object.

This is the error handling strategy used when C<trait> C<Legacy> is used.  It
was the error handling strategy employed by C<Net::Twitter> prior to version
3.00.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new

This method takes the same parameters as L<Net::Twitter/new>.

=item get_error

Returns undef if there was no error or a HASH ref containing the Twitter error
response.  Occasionally, a Twitter API call results in an error with no error
content returned from Twitter.  When that occurs, get_error returns a simulated
error HASH ref.

NOTE: Versions of C<Net::Twitter> prior to 3.0 sometimes returned a string
rather than a HASH ref, on error.  This was a bug.  Always expect undef on
success and a HASH ref on error.

=item http_code

Returns the HTTP response code the most recent API method call if it ended in error.

=item http_message

Returns the HTTP message for the most recent API method call if it ended in error.
