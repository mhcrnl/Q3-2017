Text-Editor-Easy

Version 0.01.
Several demos to see if a pure perl
editor can be usable, and more...


INSTALLATION

This is not yet an installable module. I have no namespace.

It contains a pure perl module and program. So it shouldn't be
hard to install it and run the demos.

It's compatible with Windows and UNIX. I use perl 5.8.8 on Windows
and perl 5.8.7 on Linux.

In order to execute the demos, save the archive file on
your computer (tar.gz file).
Uncompress, untar...

Now install the following modules from where you should, according to
your system (you shoud already have most of them) :
		- Tk
		- Syntax::Highlight::Perl
		- Data::Dump
		- Time::HiRes
		- IO::File
		- File::Basename
		- Scalar::Util
		- Devel::Size
		- SDBM_File
		- Fcntl
		- File::Copy

Once finished, execute the "Editor.pl" program of the "/lib/Text/Editor"
directory. I know, this is not a clean place for a program...

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

There is neither support, nor documentation because it's moving fast.

Here are a few screen copies of what you should get when running the demos :
