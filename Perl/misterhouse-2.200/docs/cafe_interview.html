<h1>CaFe.pm Interview with MisterHouse creator</h1>

<p><a href="http://misterhouse.sourceforge.net/">MisterHouse</a> is an open source home automation program.
It's fun, it's free, and it's entirely geeky. Written in Perl,
it fires events based on time, web, socket, voice, and serial data.
It currently runs on Windows 95/98/NT/2k/XP and on most Unix based
platforms, including Linux and Mac OSX.</p>
<p><strong>Please Bruce, introduce yourself to the CaFe<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=CaFe" title="create this page">?</a>.pm group</strong></p>
<p>I'm a 46 year old Electrical Engineer, living in Rochester, Minnesota,
USA, working in the IBM Engineering services division.  Our group
designs integrated circuits for a wide variety of companies, like  the
CPUs<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=CPUs" title="create this page">?</a> for the BlueGene<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=BlueGene" title="create this page">?</a> supercomputer and the 3 next generation gaming boxes.</p>
<p><strong>Which one was your motivation to build MisterHouse<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=MisterHouse" title="create this page">?</a> ??</strong></p>
<p>My house is a energy efficient earth-bermed home designed to be heated
with passive solar energy from south facing windows.  To manage that
heat gain, I installed home brewed, motor controlled window quilt
curtains, so we could open them on those cold but sunny Winter days,
then close them at night or when it was cloudy.</p>
<p>I needed software to track the indoor/outdoor temperature and sunlight
level, and control the curtains, furnace, and fans accordingly.  Once I
had MisterHouse<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=MisterHouse" title="create this page">?</a> doing those practical chores, I extended it into other
less practical, but fun  and goofy things, like controlling and speaking
through a couple of robots.</p>
<p><strong>Why it's stated that MisterHouse<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=MisterHouse" title="create this page">?</a> is entirely geeky ??</strong></p>
<p>Having your house remind you to water the plants or telling you where
your car is traveling is not for everyone.    It is a better fit for
the geeky type.  Not only are they the type that might enjoy that sort
of interaction, but also it takes some computer skill to get it
running well.</p>
<p><strong>And your family, did accept easily the idea of dealing with an automated
system ?? How did you managed this ??</strong></p>
<p>They like most of it.  The occasional bug that causes Mozart to play
over the PA system at 2 am is not so popular, but things like phone
callers being announced when the phone rings make up for it.</p>
<p><strong>What skills (Perl related or not) did you gain while you build MisterHouse<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=MisterHouse" title="create this page">?</a> ??</strong></p>
<p>I use Perl quite a bit in my chip design work at IBM.   I don't share
any of that code in MisterHouse<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=MisterHouse" title="create this page">?</a>, but I use many of the Perl tricks I
learned writing MisterHouse<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=MisterHouse" title="create this page">?</a> at work and vise-versa.</p>
<p><strong>Which devices management did you added first and why ??</strong></p>
<p>As with most home automation programs, we started by supporting X10
devices, as they are very common, simple, and inexpensive.   After
that, we add support for digital inputs and outputs and analog inputs
for things like door monitors, furnace controls, and temperature
monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>What advice will you give to the wanna be designers and hobbists facing
a new project ??</strong></p>
<p>Make it open sourced.  In the case of Home Automation, there is no way
that one person, or even a small company, could encompass all the
possible applications, so it is a perfect fit for open source.  Others
contribute as they write code to fit there specific needs, which is then
shared with others.</p>
<p><strong>In which parts of the code you will advice to the novice Perl
coder to look at, in order to have a very pleasant learning experience ?</strong></p>
<p>We have many people learn Perl so they can run MisterHouse<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=MisterHouse" title="create this page">?</a>.  There are
also quite a few who run MisterHouse<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=MisterHouse" title="create this page">?</a> as a fun way of learning Perl for
some other use.</p>
<p>We have a variety of code files listed here: <a href="http://misterhouse.net/examples.html">http://misterhouse.net/examples.html</a></p>
<p><strong>How can anyone colaborate with MisterHouse<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=MisterHouse" title="create this page">?</a> ??</strong></p>
<p>We have over 600 members on the mailing list, with almost 300 of them
listed in our authors log file as having contributed in some way.   Some
simply post suggestions or find bugs, others will post patches to fix
bugs or extend functionality, and some will write new applications.   I
take changes through the mailing list, or emailed directly to me, or via
CVS at Sourceforge.</p>
<p><strong>What features you think are missed, and which ones will you add soon ??</strong></p>
<p>The holy grail of Home Automation is reliable and convenient voice
recognition.  VR with a good headset in a quiet room works pretty well,
but not many of us wonder around the house with headsets.</p>
<p><strong>Being an electrical engineer, how do you think Perl fits in this field
?? And open source ??</strong></p>
<p>Many of the problems we face in chip design are either new or are
unique to a specific chip, so we don't always have an existing
solution we can use.   We often code up Perl scripts for quick throw
away solutions.   These programs are very specific to our design
process or chip, so they are not good candidates for sharing as open
source.</p>
<p><strong>Any favorite CPAN module ?</strong></p>
<p>That would be Bill Birthisel's SerialPort<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=SerialPort" title="create this page">?</a> module.  Thats what enables us
to talk to serial devices, on both Unix and Windows.</p>
<p><strong>Which uses of MisterHouse<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=MisterHouse" title="create this page">?</a> surprised you ?? (because of rare platforms
implementation, stange devices, not intended use, etc.)</strong></p>
<p>Some examples of MisterHouse<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=MisterHouse" title="create this page">?</a> uses:  MisterCar<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=MisterCar" title="create this page">?</a>, MisterBus<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=MisterBus" title="create this page">?</a>,
MisterAquarium<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=MisterAquarium" title="create this page">?</a>,  MisterDoorRoom<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=MisterDoorRoom" title="create this page">?</a>.    A group at Fermi Labs uses it as
MisterLab<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=MisterLab" title="create this page">?</a>, controlling some of their control room displays and giving
alerts when their anti-matter monitors show problems.   Kind of like a
computerized Scotty on Start Trek!</p>
<p><strong>Have you received feedback from the home automation industry in any way
(comments, business porposals, etc.) ??</strong></p>
<p>Not too much.   I'm enjoying this as a hobby, so do not have an interest
in this as a business.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any experience (funny or not so) that you had while making
MisterHouse<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=MisterHouse" title="create this page">?</a>  and that want to share with us ??</strong></p>
<p>A proud moment for open source authors is when they make their first
public post to the world announcing their software is available.  When I
first posted to the UseNet<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=UseNet" title="create this page">?</a> comp.home.automation list, I didn't review my
spell checker results very carefully, so I didn't notice that it changed
MisterHouse<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=MisterHouse" title="create this page">?</a> to mysterious.   Mysterious House was not what I had in mind!</p>
<p><strong>Anything else that you want to tell us and we haven't asked you ??</strong></p>
<p>You don't need a house to try MisterHouse<a class="new visualNoPrint" href="http://www.bit-man.com.ar/en/CaFePMMisterHouse/createform?page=MisterHouse" title="create this page">?</a>.  We have some guys using in
the apartments, dorm rooms, fish bowls, cars, and even national science
labs!</p>
