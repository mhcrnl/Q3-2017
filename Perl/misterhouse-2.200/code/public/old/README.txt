NetCallerID.pl
 - Timothy Spaulding's code to interface with the $30 NetCallerID box.
   In addition to normal CallerID, it supports Call Waiting CallerID
   (callerid while you are on the phone).
   Also see mh/code/bruce/phone_netcallid.pl for another example.
   This has been replaced with mh/code/common/callerid.pl
