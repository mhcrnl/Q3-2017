I've attached some scripts that may be of interest to you for MH users that
have Palm Pilots. I've avoided requiring any extra Perl modules (even tho that
would have made the job simpler!). They are not entirely modular and somewhat
personalized in places, but then again that could be said for most of the
scripts in mh/code/public :)

 -  palm_calendar.pl
This watches for changes in either mine or my wife's Palm datebook.dat
files. Any changes will trigger the makeMHCalendar script.

 - plam_calendar / palm_calendar.pl
(these do not live in users code folder, they just need to be in the path. 
I have mine in ~/bin ) 
These two scripts combine to import one or more Palm Desktop datebook.dat
files into the MH Calendar format.  I used the Palm Desktop's files rather
than the "Hotsync'd" files so even users who don't own a Palm PDA can still
use the scripts since the Palm Desktop is a free download from www.palm.com
and can be used as a standalone personal information manager (instead of that
bug ridden memory hog we know as Outlook!). I've added a few columns to the
calendar.tab file. ALARM (which is then used by a subsequent script to create
organizer_events.pl) and WHO for designating the owner of the entry since
there can be multiple sources. palmdb.pl takes 1st arg is path to calendar.tab
file, 2nd .. nth args are list pairs (path to Palm data folder [space] Name of
owner when announcing events).
