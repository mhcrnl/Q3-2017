This is code that Bruce's son Nick uses.  He runs without tk, so it takes 
few resources on his box (wouldn't want to get in the way of his games!),
and using the trayer utility, it shows up only in the Win98 tray.

On his 400 Mhz PII, it starts in about 3 seconds and uses about 2%
of his cpu.

It controls mainly stuff in his room ... he like to call it MisterRoom.
