I attach a tarball with all MH files I have modified to speak in Spanish, or
using Spain's web page. I'm sorry, but I have had not possibility of sending
those files before. If you consider this could help to other MH users please
make it available to all the community.

The modules are:
	get_earthquakes_sp and internet_earthquakes_sp.pl checks the Spanish
Geographic Institute earthquake Information Center.

	get_news_sp and news_sp.pl read news from
http://actualidad.wanadoo.es (in Spanish) and says the most recent news.

	get_tv_grid_sp, get_tv_info_sp, tv_grid_sp.pl and tv_info_sp.pl get
the tv_grid of Spain's TV stations (aerial broadcast and satellite), and
checks for programs, announcing it in Spanish.

	get_waether_inm and weather_inm.pl reads and announces the weather
information from www.inm.es (the Spanish Weather Institute).

	get_weather_meteored and weather_meteored.pl, reads and announces in
Spanish the weather from www.meteored.com (this is the weather module I'm
currently using)

	get_weather_sp and weather_sp.pl reads and announces in Spanish the
weather from es.weather.yahoo.com.

	chimes_say_time.pl announces the time and outside temperature every
hour.

	Internet_iridium_sp.pl is the same module as internet_iridium.pl but
speaking in Spanish

	internet_iss_sp.pl is a modification of internet_iridium.pl to
announces the passes of the ISS.

	time_info.pl is a modified time_info.pl to speak in Spanish.

	wakeup.pl and wakeup_sc.pl are modified versions of the original
wakeup.pl, speaking in Spanish

	weather_station_3600.pl reads the information from the LaCrosee
WS3600 weather station. It needs to run on a windows environment, and have
HaevyWeather.exe program running on the same PC. This module reads the file
currdat.lst file generated by HaevyWeather and loads all data into weather
variables. It is possible to run HeavyWeather in another PC and read the
file from a Linux environment using Samba.

	sunmoon.shtml is a modified version of the original sunmoon with all
names in Spanish.

Thanks
