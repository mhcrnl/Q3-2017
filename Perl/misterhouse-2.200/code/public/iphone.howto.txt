/1/ Apply the diff for Groups.pm to be able to define Groups of Groups and get rid of the sort.
/2/ copy the iphone directory into your web directory so that it is reached as http://ip:8080/iphone
/3/ Apply the diff for http_server.pm
/4/ Copy iphone.pl into a code directory of your choice.

Think of the following tree syntax of a possible menu as an example

* First Floor
** kitchen
** living room
** ...
* Second Floor
** Bedroom1
** Bedroom2
** Masterbedroom
** Bathroom

To define that use the default group functionality within Misterhouse. Prerequisit is that you defined a group per room with the on board methods from Misterhouse. In this example you have defined already groups like FF_kitchen, FF_livingroom, SF_bedroom1, SF_bedroom2, SF_masterbedroom, SF_bathroom, ...) If you are not familiar with Groups, pls. read the manual.

Do that in your user code directory f.e. in a file called groups.pl:
<pre>
$gFF               = new Group;
$gFF               -> add($FF_kitchen);
$gFF               -> add($FF_livingroom);

$gSF               = new Group;
$gSF               -> add($SF_bedroom1);
$gSF               -> add($SF_bedroom2);
$gSF               -> add($SF_masterbedroom);
$gSF               -> add($SF_bathroom);

$Main              = new Group;
$Main              -> add($gFF);
$Main              -> add($gSF);
</pre>

in the web/iphone directory you find index.shtml. The group name Main is there referenced in the line

<pre>
<!--#include code="&iphoneWebApp('Main','iLayer')"-->
</pre>
Feel free to use another Group name as Main, but take care in index.shtml to reference the same Group.

This should be enough to get the basic functionality running. More is documented in the Wiki in the near future.

If you want more now, pls study the labels.pl.example code and adapt it to your environment the index.shtml.example or write me an email r(at)lf-klueber(dot)de
