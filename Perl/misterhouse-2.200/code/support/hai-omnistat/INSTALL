Based on work from several others (see credits in source files) 
For tracking/changelog purposes, this is version 2.0 from Marc MERLIN 2010/01/09

edit mh.private.ini and set some variables (see Omnistat.pm for options
available).  Mine are:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#debug=omnistat
Omnistat_serial_port=/dev/ttyUSB0
Omnistat_24hr=1
Omnistat_stat_log=9
# Setting new temperature and settings only works until the next
# programmed change unset this for changes to set the stat to 'hold'
# mode where it'll keep your setting forever
Omnistat_set_does_not_hold=1

# These options tell misterhouse not to disable code/foo.pl modules
# if they trigger occasional errors in this module (they can happen since
# serial port communication is not fully reliable).
omnistat_allowed_errors = 999999999999
hvac_allowed_errors = 999999999999
# This tells bin/mh to show the full error each time there is a die, this helps
# keeping track of serial port burps.
show_all_errors = yes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

omnistat.pl should go to your mh/code/omnistat.pl and you should edit it to 
setup your thermostat(s)

Make sure your files in mh/web/hai are readable by the mh user. If not,
you may get a file download request by your browser (untarring and
copying the files with proper permissions should do this for you)

After this, you should be able to access
http://server:8080/hai/
http://server:8080/hai/omnistat_sched_web.pl
http://server:8080/hai/omnistat_setup.pl
and even
http://server:8080/hai/omnistat_setup.pl?location=mystat2
