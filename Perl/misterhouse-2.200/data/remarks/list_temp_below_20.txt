It's a bit nippy out, mate.
This is nothing. Try talking to Eliza, SHE is cold!
And school isn't even canceled. Bah!
The brocolli is dying! Bwahahahaha!
Take me down to the Paradise City where it isn't so cold!
You could freeze an Altoid in this weather.
Watch out for vicious snow men!
You know, if you get cold enough, your snot will freeze solid in your nose.

Snowball weather.
Anyone up for a game of cricket?
I think I just saw a snowman making a run for it.

It is cold.
