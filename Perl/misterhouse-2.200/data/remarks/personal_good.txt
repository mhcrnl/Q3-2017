Please don't hurt me, O great one!
You are way better than your brother.
Do you want a burrito? They are good!
Your father loves you so much he will give you money to type lame remarks like this if you want.
Yeah, you know what I'm saying.
You are the master of all.
My, you look mighty fine today.
Did I ever tell you how much I admire your left ear?
Your hair styleing looks very stylish today.
Nice looking outfit you have on.
