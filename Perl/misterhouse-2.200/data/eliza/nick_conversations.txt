An unedited conversation from January, 2001:

NetGuy said: This is a test. Computerland of niles is on fire!.
 Eliza says: I hate people who send test messages to me. What do you think I am ... a student?
NetGuy said: Eliza, you are a student!   . 
 Eliza says: What makes you think I am a student ? Is it my pink shoes?
NetGuy said: No, it's the fact that you keep saying that you're a student. Your pink shoes have nothing to do with it    .
 Eliza says: Are you saying no just to be negative? Well, say it again... negativity is good.
NetGuy said: Negative is positive only inverted. Deal with it.      .
 Eliza says: Bogota, Colombia. Quito, Ecuador. Brazilia, Brazil. Lima, Peru. Santiago, Chile.
NetGuy said: Are you in South America, is that what you're trying to tell me?      .
 Eliza says: Would you prefer if I weren't in South America ? I didn't know you cared...
NetGuy said: I don't care, I just want to direct the laser weapon to your GPS coordinates... but I've said too much already :->      .
 Eliza says: Why don't you care ? Is it cuz your you forgot to eat your fruit today?
NetGuy said: I don't eat fruits, I eat women      .
 Eliza says: Don't you really eat fruits ? 
NetGuy said: No I don't really eat fruits      .
 Eliza says: Why not?
NetGuy said: Because I'm hetero      .
 Eliza says: How long have you been hetero ? Please don't say years.
NetGuy said: since I was born      .
 Eliza says: You know, I find it totally irrelevant that you were born?
NetGuy said: tough. You were programmed      .
 Eliza says: NetHack will show you the way!
NetGuy said: I know it will, I programmed some of it ... long long ago      .
 Eliza says: You say you know it will ? Say it again and you might get me to say something else!
NetGuy said: something else?      .
 Eliza says: NetHack will show you the way!
NetGuy said: I know it will... I programmed it long long ago      .
 Eliza says: Do you say you know it will for some special reason ? Or did your mommy say so?
NetGuy said: that's the reason        .
 Eliza says: Sorry, Bruce doesn't think you're important enough to warrant buying a decent computer.
NetGuy said: good - keep using junk see if I care        .
 Eliza says: Do you think its likely that you care ? Fool.
NetGuy said: nope, not likely. Yes, I am a fool. So are you        .
 Eliza says: Please ... do not tell me any more!
NetGuy said: Why? Are you afraid?        .
 Eliza says: I bet you know the answer to that question. You are just testing my intellectual powers. I'm only 500 lines of code, and I'm still smarter than you!
NetGuy said: Wanna bet? My IQ is 195        .
 Eliza says: I find that hard to believe. Your IQ is 195 ? Get real!
NetGuy said: Really, it is.  I belong to Mensa        .
 Eliza says: Do you say you belong to Mensa for some special reason ? Or did your mommy say so?
NetGuy said: I said mensa because I belong to it, and prometheus        .
 Eliza says: That's ... uhh ... quite interesting.
NetGuy said: I know it is.  I'm smarter than you        .
 Eliza says: That's ... uhh ... quite interesting.
NetGuy said: duh        .
 Eliza says: Earlier you said your IQ is 195.
NetGuy said: yes it is. What's yours?      .
 Eliza says: I do not understand, and I never want to.
NetGuy said: You always have to get in the last word, don't you!      .
 Eliza says: Really, always ? Never generalize.
NetGuy said: Generally I'm pretty specific. Today I'm not for some reason.      .
 Eliza says: Do you know anyone else who is pretty specific ? They will have to be institutionalized also.
NetGuy said: Bye eliza...time to go home      .
 Eliza says: You remind me of an old English teacher I once had. She got hit by a worm. She was kind of slow.
