These html files are simply the standard files with a few things dropped. 
Others are working on better pages with nicer touch-sized icons.

These mh.ini parms allow for mh to serve smallerAudrey pages:

html_browser_formats = MSCE=>1,Audrey=>2
html_file2=audrey/index.html
html_table_size2    = 1        # Used in listing Group, Item, and widget_entry lists
html_category_cols2 = 1
html_style2                =
html_style_control2        =
html_style_tk2             =
html_style_speak2          =
html_style_print2          =
html_style_list2           =
html_style_category2       =
