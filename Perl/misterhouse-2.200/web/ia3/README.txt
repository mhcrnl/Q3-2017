Any suggestions from other epods owners would be appreciated. 

For those unfamiliar with ePods, it is a hacked WinCE webpad. 640x480 color
touchpad display, 16MB memory, cf, USB and pcmcia slot.  These pages should
also work on the Audrey machines.  (Although I don't have one yet to test with.)

Some of the pages still need work, and as you can see these are a little on the manual
side to edit.  Any and all suggestions are welcome.
