Some info from Jeffrey Ferris on WAP:

WAP: Wireless Application Protocol.  WML is XML for wireless things, like phones.

Then there are "Decks" and "Cards" within a wml page...The deck is
essentially the page, cards are various small wap-bite-sized chunks of the
deck...I think.  :) Right now, I'm doing single-deck, single-card. A good
basic intro/overview is at

http://www.wapdesign.org.uk/tutorial.html

Slightly more detail at
http://www.wirelessdevnet.com/training/WAP/WML.html

and you need these mime types:
.wml	text/vnd.wap.wml
.wmls	text/vnd.wap.wmlscript
.wbmp	image/vnd.wap.wbmp
