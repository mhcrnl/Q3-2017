Index2 is an attempt to use MH server side html parsing
to automatically display the outside temperature based on
the $Weather{TempOutdoor} hash. Index2.shtml is also 
enlarged slightly to better fit that Audrey screen.

Todo -- would be nice to automatically select C or F depending
on user preferences. Hardcoded to C for us canucks
