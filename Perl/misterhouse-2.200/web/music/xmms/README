Hi

This subdirectory define a basic jukebox for Linux
It need few things to be set before you could use this program


This software use xmms to run the jukebox
It relies on Xmms-perl module from CPAN to send command to the jukebox
This need to be installed.

There is 3 parameters who need to be set in the mh.ini file
mp3_program        declare the xmms program with is complete path
mp3_playlist_dir   define the main playlist directory
html_alias_jukebox alias to the directory containing the web jukebox application

Create a new directory, and put all the file from this package
Let say we put everything in /usr/local/mh/code/web_jukebox

define the path with html_alias_jukebox in mh.ini as
  html_alias_jukebox = /jukebox /usr/local/mh/code/web_jukebox


Then define playlist

Under the main playlist directory, declared by mp3_playlist_dir in mh.ini, 
you have multiple directory.  Each of them contains playlist file.
A playlist file will contains a list of MP3 file, with their complete path
All the playlist filename should end by ".m3u"

Then all the directory under mp3_playlist_dir, will be accessible via the interface.
On my system, I declare few directory
artist, album, rock, techno, classical.

You also need the XmmsControl.pl,this file should be part of the distribution.

Once all the step are done, you could access the jukebox via the misterhouse
webpage under /jukebox
