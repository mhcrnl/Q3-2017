From Jeff H on 04/2002:


I wanted to post a follow-up on getting this working so that it would be in
the archives for others (or in case I forget it ;-)). Many thanks to all the
great MH guys who reponded and especially Gaetan and Bob Hughes for helping
me identify the missing link! I was missing xmms-devel and didn't know about
it.

Linux Users - Xmms Mp3 Player
=======================
To integrate Xmms into MisterHouse and use the IA5 interface for control, do
the following:
1. Get the required packages, compile and install. Xmms-Perl is now included
in the xmms-devel distro. Make certain you have the same version of
xmms-devel as your xmms package. You must have:
   xmms - This is the MP3 player, of course.
   xmms-devel - This is the control API for xmms.
   Xmms-Perl - This is the Perl interface to the xmms-devel API.
2. Copy the Xmms_Control.pl, Xmms_jukebox.pl and mp3_playlist_xmms.pl code
modules into your code directory.
3. Make sure you edit mh.ini (or mh.private.ini) and set the mp3 player var
(mp3_program=/usr/bin/xmms ).
4. Change the RUN commands in web/misc/mp3_top.html to match the voice
commands in Xmms_jukebox.pl.

And you should be set. If anyone sees anything I missed, feel free to add
but I think I remembered everything here.

Jeff
