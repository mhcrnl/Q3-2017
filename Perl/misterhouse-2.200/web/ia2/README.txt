From Craig Schaeffer  06/2001:

Note: some of the links in the 'Other' section of
this code call code in my mh_craig directory, so they obviously won't work on
your system. Perhaps I'll post them someday.

Any suggestions from other epods owners would be appreciated. Or am I the only
mh epodsian?

For those unfamiliar with epods, it is a hacked WinCE webpad. 640x480 color
touchpad display, 16MB memory, cf and pcmcia slot. I connect mine wirelessly
using a D-Link card/access point. Epods are selling for about $300 on EBay.
