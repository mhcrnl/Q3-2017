                      RASDIAL95 1.1 (4/3/98)
		 Command-line Remote Access Dialer for Windows 95


RASDIAL95 is a command-line remote access (dial-up networking) dialer for
Windows 95.  It's based on the RASDIAL command on Windows NT and the usage 
is very similar.  RASDIAL95 will allow you to dial and hangup a remote
access phone entry.

USAGE:
	To dial:
		rasdial95 entryname [username [password]] [/DOMAIN:domain]
				  [/PHONE:phonenumber] [/CALLBACK:callbacknumber]
			The entry name is the name of the icon that is in the dial-up
			networking folder.  Enclose the entry name in double quotes if
			it contains spaces.
			If the phone number is specified, it overrides the number stored
			in the dial-up connection icon.

	To disconnect:
		rasdial95 [entryname] /DISCONNECT
			If an entry name is not specified, the first connection will be
			disconnected.

	To list connected entries:
		rasdial95

ERROR LEVELS:
	For integration into batch files, the following errorlevels are
	returned by RASDIAL95:
	
	0:	When dialing, errorlevel 0 is returned if the specified entry
	    was successfully dialed or if it was already connected.
		When hanging up, errorlevel 0 is returned if the specified
		entry was successfully hanged up or if it was not connected.

	1:  Errorlevel 1 is returned if the dial or hangup command fails.

	2:	Errorlevel 2 is returned if the dial command was aborted by
		the user with Control-C or Control-Break.

REVISION HISTORY:

1.0	(11/08/97):
	o	Initial release

1.1	(4/3/98):
