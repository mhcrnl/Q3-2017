Todo list for Time Plan. If you want to help out pick one and code it

Planned features:
man page
more data files for different purposes
conflict handling
handle items that can't be fit into the schedule
more error checking
better file format for the data files (probably xml)
generate the schedule in different formats for viewing/printing: png, jpg, postscript, pdf, html, ascii art, plain text
category system
try to give the user variety by choosing things from different categories after each other
priority system
a way to specify that some tasks belong to each other, and use that info when generating the schedule
a way to specify that something should be completed before something else (for example if you're reading a series of books and there is a chronological order)
a cli tool to edit the data files

Features that may or may not get done:
a graphical frontend (probably gtk) that shows the schedule in real time
including the ability to edit the data files in the gui tool
