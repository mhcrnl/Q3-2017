Some made up example files are provided for you to modify

The file fomat is very simple for now:

<approx_minutes_it_takes_to_complete>(tab)<item description>
or:
<approx_minutes_it_takes_to_complete>(tab)<item description>(tab><time_to_start>

This will be redone in the future, but it works for now.

this is the file/directory structure:
daily.txt - things that happen every day
year/month/day.txt - specify something that happens on a specific date
weekday/dayx.txt - specify something that happens on weekday x, (1 = monday, 7 = sunday)
todo/ - this dir contains todo items
todo/dailyrandom.txt - something random from this one gets on the schedule every day
todo/simpleprojects.txt - right now we pick a random thing from this, but in the future we will
                          take things from here until we have filled up the gaps in the schedule.
special/ - this dir contains files with special cases. for now this means eating, so you can add
           a few meals you like and have it randomly pick one each day, good if you're on of those
           who are having a hard time figuring out what to eat :)

many more files for specifying things during different times/situations will be in future releases


If you don't want one of those to be used just leave the file empty.
