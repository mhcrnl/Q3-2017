This is Time Plan, a program that will help you organize what you do with your time

USAGE: timeplan [date]
date - view the schedule of this date, it handles all common formats of writing a date, including
       including things like '2006-05-21' or 'tomorrow' or 'in 3 days' or 'may 5th' or probably 
	   whatever else you can come up with

Enter things you do in data files based on four types of things:
daily - things that happen every day
date specific - things you do once, on a specific date
day of week - things you do, say, every friday
todo list - things you want to do or are going to do

You specify a description of each task, how many minutes you think it'll take, and
optionally a start time. If you specify a start time it will appear at that time
in the schedule, and if you leave the start time out time plan will search your schedule
for gaps large enough to fit the task and put togheter the best schedule it can.
To find out more just give it a try, the binary is called 'timeplan'.
