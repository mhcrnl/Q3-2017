<H2>Introduction </H2></A>
<P>News Clipper is a Perl program that allows people to integrate dynamic 
information their web page. This information might be something simple, 
like the date, or complex, like a set of links to recent Usenet postings. 
News Clipper allows the user to specify, using an HTML-like syntax, the 
source of data, how that data should be filtered, and how that data should 
be output. </P>
<P>By separating acquisition of data, filtering of data, and output of 
data, web designers are given more freedom to control the presentation of 
data. For example, you can specify that all headlines from Yahoo Tech News 
that have to do with Microsoft, Linux, or Y2K should be printed in three 
column , with the word Linux highlighted. Here's how the HTML might look: <PRE>&lt;!--newsclipper
&lt;input name=yahootopstories source=tech&gt;
&lt;filter name=grep words="microsoft,linux,y2k"&gt;
&lt;filter name=map filter=highlight words="microsoft,linux,y2k"&gt;
&lt;output name=array numcols=3&gt;
--&gt;
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>Originally News Clipper was designed for a single user (me), but some 
effort has been spent to make it more generally useful. DOS/Windows 
installation is supported, as is system installation as Perl modules, and 
global HTML and image caches. Now timezones are supported for people whose 
time zone doesn't correspond to the server's. </P>
<hr><A 
name=install>
<H2>Installation </H2></A>
<P>News Clipper is a Perl program. If you are on a Unix-derived operating 
system, you should have it installed already. If you are on a DOS or 
Windows system, you are likely to have more difficulties that average 
users. If you are a Windows user and have never heard of Perl, you might 
be in for even more difficulty. (i.e. Find someone who can help you.) </P>
<P>Instructions: 
<OL>
<LI>Download the distribution. 
<LI>Unzip and untar it. 
<LI>Read the README for detailed installation instructions. 
<LI>No really, read the README. 
<LI>For a system-wide installation, do <TT>perl Makefile.PL</TT>, 
<TT>make</TT>, <TT>make install</TT>. (You may need to use nmake or 
dmake if you are on a Windows platform.) 
<LI>Do "perldoc NewsClipper.pl" to see how to run the script, in 
general. 
<LI>Run "NewsClipper.pl -i template.txt -o output.html" to see the 
script download the handlers and create the file output.html from 
template.txt. 
<LI>Visit the 
<a href="http://www.newsclipper.com/handlers.htm">handlers</A> 
webpage for more tags you can use. </LI></OL>
<P></P>
<P>Read the README for more detailed instructions. Also check the <A 
href="http://www.newsclipper.com/techsup.htm">FAQ</A> 
if you run into problems. </P>
<P></P>
<hr><A 
name=config>
<H2>Configuration </H2></A>
<P>For a complete description of all configuration options, run "perldoc 
NewsClipper.pl". Here are a few notes regarding the various configuration 
parameters. More description can be found in the NewsClipper.cfg file 
itself. </P>
<P>When News Clipper is run with the -c switch, the specified file is used 
as a configuration file. Otherwise, News Clipper looks for a configuration 
file in ~user/.NewsClipper, then SYSCONFIGDIR, which is set in 
NewsClipper.pl during installation time. </P>
<P>On Windows systems, the TZ environment variable is set in the 
configuration file during installation. </P>
<P>For single user installations, the News Clipper modules will not be in 
the standard Perl locations. In this case, modulepath in the configuration 
file is set to point to them. (This means you don't have to change your 
PERL5LIB environment variable or run perl with the -I flag.) </P>
<P>Timeouts are used to prevent News Clipper from running too long, and to 
prevent unresponsive remote servers from slowing things down. Set 
sockettimeout to the maximum amount of time that you want News Clipper to 
wait for a response from a server. Set scripttimeout to the maximum time 
that you want News Clipper to run. (Note that scripttimeout should be 
about equal to sockettimeout times the number of News Clipper tags in your 
input files.) </P>
<P>News Clipper can handle multiple input and output files. Be sure that 
the number of input files equals the number of output files. </P>
<P>News Clipper caches remote web pages internally. This means that an ISP 
with 100 users using the "lycosweather" handler won't hit the Lycos server 
100 times. Also, authors of handlers specify the times that data is 
updated on remote servers, and News Clipper will only fetch data if it has 
been updated since the last time it was fetched. This is useful for things 
like comics, which only update once a day. </P>
<P>The "cacheimages" handler caches remote images locally. When given a 
bit of HTML with &lt;img src="URLx"&gt;, it caches the image pointed to by 
URLx, and substitutes a local URLy in the place of URLx. cacheimages also 
deletes old images from the cache after a specified time. These options 
can be given default values in the configuration file, which lets system 
maintainers provide a global image cache for all users. </P>
<P>News Clipper also allows the user to specify the location where 
handlers should be stored. System maintainers can point this value to a 
globally accessible directory. Otherwise, it defaults to 
~user/.NewsClipper/NewsClipper/Handler, where ~user is the user's home 
directory. </P>
<hr><A 
name=running>
<H2>Running News Clipper </H2></A>
<P>There are different ways of using the script: 
<UL>
<LI>Probably the best way to run the script is from a cron job. To do 
this, create a .crontab file with something similar to the 
following:<BR><TT>0 7,10,13,16,19,22 * * * 
/path/NewsClipper.pl</TT><BR>The first field 
is the minute, and the second field is the hour(s). You have to specify 
the complete path to the script. Then you can make the output file your 
startup page in Netscape. 
<LI>You could make cgiwrap call your startup page, but this would mean 
having to wait for the script to execute (2 to 30 seconds, depending on 
the staleness of the information). 
<LI>And you could just run the script manually from the command line... 
</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>If called as a CGI program, the output file is echoed to standard 
output with the text "Content-type: text/html" preceding it. This allows 
it to be called dynamically over the net via cgiwrap. For example:<BR>
&lt;a 
href="http://www.host.com/cgi-bin/cgiwrap?user=you&amp;script=NewsClipper.pl"&gt;</A>. 
</P>
<P>The first time you run the script each day, it may a half-minute or so 
to collect the information (depending on network load and amount of data 
to aquire). But after that, the script is very fast because is will only 
pull data from the net if it needs to. </P>

<hr><A 
name=works>
<H2>How It Works </H2></A>
<P>NewsClipper.pl processes command line options, the configuration file, 
and input and output files. Each input file is parsed, and when a comment 
of the form &lt;!-- newsclipper...--&gt; is found, the comment is parsed 
for commands to be executed. </P>
<P>If there is only one command to be executed (an input command), 
News Clipper determines the default filter and output handlers from the input 
handler. The resulting (expanded) command list will be composed of an 
input command, zero or more filter commands, and an output command. </P>
<P>During input commands, the cache is checked to see if fresh data still 
exists. If not, the data is grabbed from the net, stored in the cache, and 
then used by the handler. </P>
<P>Each command is executed, and the results are fed into the next 
command. If anything goes wrong, News Clipper inserts a comment in the 
output file describing the problem. </P>
<P>If, at any time, a handler can not be found, News Clipper prompts the 
user to download it. The -n flag can be used to tell News Clipper to check 
for new versions of handlers, and the -a flag can be used to automatically 
download them. </P>
<hr><A 
name=tags>
<H2>The News Clipper Tag Language </H2></A>
<P>With the release of News Clipper 7.0, users have much more flexibility 
when it comes to choosing how data should be displayed on their web pages. 
This is achieved by separating data acquisition, modification, and output 
into distinct steps. </P>
<P>A newsclipper tag is composed of three types of commands: <TT>&lt;input 
name=...&gt;</TT>, <TT>&lt;filter name=...&gt;</TT>, and <TT>&lt;output 
name=...&gt;</TT>;. The first part of the command tells News Clipper how 
to execute the command. The name attribute tells News Clipper which 
handler to use for the command. Additional attributes can also be 
specified for the command, and are passed on to the handler. Each handler 
has a set of default filter and output handler commands, so if you only 
specify the input command, the defaults are used. </P>
<P>First off, terminology: a <STRONG>string</STRONG> is a sequence of 
characters, possibly containing newlines. Strings can be HTML or regular 
text, and it doesn't matter to News Clipper. An <STRONG>array</STRONG> is 
an ordered list of items. The items can be anything, even another array. A 
<STRONG>hash</STRONG> is an unordered list with named entries. For 
example, you might have 3 strings, each corresponding to the "author", 
"URL", and "description". The names in a hash are called the 
<STRONG>keys</STRONG>. </P>
<P>One important thing to note is the type of data that is input and 
output from each command. For example, if you use an input command that 
generates a list of items, and you then try to filter this list with a 
filter that expects a single string of data, an error will occur. The 
input and output types are documented in the comments of the handler.pm 
file located in your handlers directory, and also at the <A 
href="http://www.newsclipper.com/handlers.htm">handler 
webpage</A>. </P>
<P>There are over 100 handlers that can be used in input commands. Some 
handlers also perform filtering and output commands if the data that they 
generate is very specific to the handler. The majority of handlers, 
however, generate strings, lists, and hashes that can be manipulated using 
generic filters and output using generic output handlers. </P>
<P>Below is an example tag: <PRE>&lt;!-- newsclipper
&lt;input name=slashdot type=articles&gt;
&lt;filter name=slashdot type=LinksAndText&gt;
&lt;filter name=limit number=4&gt;
&lt;filter name=map filter=limit number=200 chars&gt;
&lt;output name=array numcols=2 prefix="&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt;" suffix="&lt;/p&gt;"&gt;
--&gt;
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>This tag specifies nearly everything, including values that already 
have defaults. The first command results in an array of hashes containing 
information about the current Slashdot articles. The next command is a 
filter, which uses one of the filters in the slashdot handler. The 
slashdot filter returns an array of strings, which is then sent to the 
generic "limit" filter to reduce the number of strings to four. </P>
<P>At this point, we have an array of four (or less) strings containing 
Slashdot links and text. The next command is a "map" filter, which applies 
another filter to the contents of a data structure. In this case, the map 
filter is applying the limit filter to the text in each item of our array. 
("number=200 chars" tells the limit filter that we want to limit the 
number of characters, not the number of lines, which is the default 
behavior for strings.) </P>
<P>The final step is to print the array of shortened strings, so we send 
the data to the "array" handler, and tell it to print in two columns using 
our own special bullets and spacing. </P>
<P>The output might look something like this:

<H3>Built-in Filter Handlers </H3>
<P>Each of these filters comes pre-installed with News Clipper. They will 
not be located in your .NewsClipper directory, but in the same location as 
the other News Clipper modules. (This location depends on your system 
configuration, and whether or not you did a site-wide installation.) </P>
<P><STRONG>&lt;filter name=grep words=X invert&gt; </STRONG><BR>grep is 
named after the Unix command for finding lines in a file that contain a 
pattern. It takes a string, array, or hash, and returns the data that 
contain one of a set of words. The "invert" attribute can be used to 
return the data that does *not* contain the keyword. (Note that in the 
case of the hash, it isn't the keys, but the values that are searched.) 
</P>
<P><STRONG>&lt;filter name=selectkeys keys=X invert&gt; </STRONG><BR>Takes 
and returns a smaller hash with the given keys. "invert" returns the hash 
that does not contain the keys. </P>
<P><STRONG>&lt;filter name=highlight style=X words=Y&gt; 
</STRONG><BR>Highlight surrounds the specified words with a HTML tags. The 
style is "strong" by default. </P>
<P><STRONG>&lt;filter name=limit number=X chars&gt; </STRONG><BR>Accepts a 
string, array, or hash, and returns the same. This filter trims the number 
of characters, lines, items, or keys to the number specified. "chars" must 
be specified if you want to treat strings as sequences of characters 
instead of lines. </P>
<P><STRONG>&lt;filter name=hash2array order=X&gt; </STRONG><BR>hash2array 
takes a hash and a given key ordering, and returns an array whose items 
are the hash values in the specified order. </P>
<P><STRONG>&lt;filter name=map depth=X filter=Y [...]&gt; 
</STRONG><BR>Suppose you have an array of strings, and want to apply the 
highlight filter to the strings. Unfortunately, highlight doesn't take 
arrays of strings. That's what this filter is for. "depth" tells map how 
many levels into your data structure to go before applying the filter 
given by "filter". Any additional arguments are passed on to the filter. 
</P>
<P><STRONG>&lt;filter name=cacheimages maxage=X dir=Y url=Z&gt; 
</STRONG><BR>Suppose you have an array of HTML image links, and you want 
to cache them locally, and translate the links to point to the local 
images. Give cacheimages the "dir" to store the images in, the "url" that 
corresponds to that dir on the web, and it will download the images and 
store them for you. "maxage" tells the filter that it can delete images 
older than a certain number of seconds. </P>
<H3>Built-in Output Handlers </H3>
<P><STRONG>&lt;output name=string&gt; </STRONG><BR>Prints a string. </P>
<P><STRONG>&lt;output name=table header=X border=Y&gt; </STRONG><BR>Takes 
a two-dimensional array and outputs a table having a border size as given 
by "border". "header" allows you to specify whether the top and/or left 
sides of the table should be headers. </P>
<P><STRONG>&lt;output name=array numcols=W prefix=X suffix=Y 
separator=Z&gt; </STRONG><BR>Output an array of strings. "numcols" is the 
number of columns. "prefix", "separator" and "suffix" are strings to print 
before, between, and after each item. If prefix is "ul" or "ol", a 
bulletted or numbered list is created. </P>
<P><STRONG>&lt;output name=thread style=X&gt; </STRONG><BR>Takes a 
"thread" data type, like you would see in discussion lists. Outputs using 
numbered or unnumbered lists, depending on whether the style is "ol" or 
"ul". See the handler's comments for a description of the thread data 
type. </P>
