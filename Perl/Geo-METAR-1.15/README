BACKGROUND

    This is the README file for the Geo::METAR Perl module.

    The Geo::METAR home page is located at:

        http://idefix.net/~koos/perl/Geo-METAR/

    There may be bugs in the code as well as in the documentation. If
    you find either, I'd appreciate a patch or at least a mail message
    to let me know what's wrong so that I can add it to the TODO list.

    Geo::METAR as been developed and tested on Linux and Solaris as
    well as Windows NT. It may well work on other platforms. It is
    pure Perl. If you install it on another platform, and have trouble
    I'd like to hear about it. If you develop patches for that
    platform, I'd REALLY like to hear about it. Send me a note.

REQUIREMENTS

    You will need Perl 5.005 or newer to install and use
    Geo::METAR. It may work with older versions of Perl, but I make no
    guarantees.


INSTALLATION

    Installing Geo::METAR is an easy process.

      $ perl Makefile.PL
      $ make
      $ make test
      $ make install


DOCUMENTATION

    The documentation is built-in to the Geo::METAR module in POD
    format.  You can use any of the pod2* converters to translate it
    to a more readable format. The three most common formats are
    'man', 'html', and 'text'.

    When you ran the 'make install' above, documentation should have
    been installed on your system such that 'perldoc Geo::METAR' will
    spit it out.  Of course, you can run your favorite pod converter
    and generate it in alternative formats.


EXAMPLE SCRIPTS

    The following scripts are included in the `examples'
    directory. They are provided as examples. They should provide an
    idea of what you can do with this module.

      simple_dump.pl       Process a simple METAR.
      fetch_temp.pl	       Fetch the temperature and print it out.

    If you develop a good example that would be useful to others, I'd
    be glad to add it to the distribution.


TODO LIST

    If you're wondering what will come next in Geo::METAR, see the
    TODO file.
