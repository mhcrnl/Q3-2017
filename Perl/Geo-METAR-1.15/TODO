                            METAR Wishlist

Following is a list of items that I'd like to add to METAR or that
others have requested. I've listed them here in the order that they're
likely to be completed.


  * Improved the test suite.

    It'd be nice to have a lot of METARs which encompass various
    weather condition which we can test against.


  * International METAR support.

    Sites around the world use similar (but slightly different)
    formats for their METARs. There is always a METAR format the parser
    will fail on.


  * Calculate Heat Index and/or Wind Chill

    Both would be fairly easy to do, provided you get the formulas
    correct. (Those vary around the world!)


If you'd like to submit a patch for any of these, please let me know!
Please put 'METAR' in the subject of your e-mail.
