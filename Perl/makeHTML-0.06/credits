  Much thanks to the
    Rehabilitationszentrum Rudolf-Sophien-Stift gGmbH
  were I do my 'Zivildienst' at the moment. I have to create their homepage to-
  geather with a colleague (and of course we do many many other things ;-).
  There I put my old idea of a script like this one into practise at a bigger
  homepage than mine.

  Also much thanks to these helpers:
  
  Markus Espenhain (markus.espenhain@schwaben.de)
    for his help with the first projects for which we created the script.
  Klaus Roeller (klaus@obermarchtal.com ???)
    for the ideas for the first public version
